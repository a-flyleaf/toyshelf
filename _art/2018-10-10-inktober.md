caption: Two drawings in pen & ink, both rendered with tons of loose lines. The first is a headshot of an old dog that appears to be melting, on a similarly drippy background; the collar tag reads "Buddy." The second features a younger Ivy in the rain, cradling a melting canine skull; she looks furious.
