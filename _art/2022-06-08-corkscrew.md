  1) A side view bust of the "sawface" monster, titled "can opener." In subsequent images: 2) the upper and lower mouths swing open, the middle jaw protruding further, and 3) the middle "jaw" spins.
  
  Below this flagrant blasphemy of nature, a brief comic sequence depicts the same, but this time the monster starts drilling underground.

From the 7th, but forward-dated for backend site generation reasons. Originally posted as part of [a monthly art roundup](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/roundup-06-2022-hodge-of-podge-921010209).

I really, really do not know why I was compelled to call [this thing](https://beerboxes-com.3dcartstores.com/Tavern-Wing-Corkscrew-Carded-Stainless-Steel-previously-34-2039_p_341.html) a can opener, but I was enthralled nonetheless.
