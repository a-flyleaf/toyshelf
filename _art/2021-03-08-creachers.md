  Grayscale sketches of the "sawface" monster:
  - side view headshot
  - towering in a giant doorway, cowering a person who's very small in comparison
  - sketchy fullbody-silhouette
  - torso-up of the monster's heads tearing out of a human's mouth and neck. Jokey dialogue: (monster) "i will cause horror on purpose" / (human) "gdi bro"
  
  There is also a [Japhet](https://off.fandom.com/wiki/Japhet) at the bottom; "unrelated."
