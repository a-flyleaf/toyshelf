  A vertical composition of headshots, featuring:
  - Ava in black, white, and yellow, smiling and making a "shh" hand
  - Nico in sharp lines and stark cyan lighting
  - Ivy in round lineless and a dark reddish palette
  - A silhouette of Tara, mouth open in a frown. A white scribble appears to burst violently from her forehead.

Still not Doing Anything with any of them but they’re good for spontaneous standalones like this <span style="display:inline-block">\o/</span>
