caption: Lineless shots of Ivy and Nico in dramatic poses, each framed by (and ignoring the boundaries of) their associated shapes and colors (Ivy in a cyan oval, Nico in a light red polygon). Ivy, furious, grabs Nico's arm; Nico is making a finger gun hand, rolling his eyes and sticking his tongue out in annoyance.

Aforementioned "dragonsonas" are on Flight Rising: at the time of writing, [2017!Nico](https://www1.flightrising.com/dragon/51774952)'s bio features a cropped version of this art, while [2017!Ivy](https://www1.flightrising.com/dragon/64836488) has a separate drawing entirely (because hers didn't work as well as a standalone).

As an additional artist's note, they're both cartoonishly exaggerated here, Ivy moreso. Strong posing for visual clarity does not get along with the way normal human beings tend to interact.
