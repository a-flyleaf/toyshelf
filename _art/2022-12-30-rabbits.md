  Assorted art of the hellrabbit.
  - <b>9/12</b>: The rabbit, collared, sits all cutesy.
  - <b>11/24</b>: Snippet from a meme (linked below). Prompt: "Why is six afraid of seven". The "six" character gestures at "seven" (the hellrabbit); "<em style="text-transform:uppercase;">Why</em>," he yells, "<em style="text-transform:uppercase;">do you **think.**</em>" (The rabbit simply offers an "owo?")
  - The rest of the canvas features "panels" (and one meme) from October 2022--January 2023, also linked below. (After the "who would win" meme, it seems "the eldritch horror bunny won. spoiler alert, <abbr title="I guess">ig</abbr>...")

First two snippets are from monthly roundups (September snip from [the August canvas](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/roundup-08-2022-shortest-roundup-EVAR-928145235), which was posted late; [November](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/roundup-11-2022-spongebob-fish-voice-MY-LEG-943240452) includes [this OC meme template](https://www.deviantart.com/misuteru/art/OC-Meme-Remix-Blank-616616117)). The rest is excerpted from [this batshit thing](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/ygbtdm/au/splash) I spent the end of the year making.
