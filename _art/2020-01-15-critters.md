  Sketches of some critters:
  - Zero, looking disgruntled, holding and tapping a "0 days since last reminder of my existence" sign
  - side view fullbody and detail shots of the **eel-horse-raptor**
    - from a 'combine 3 unrelated animals' project @ [school redacted]
    - yeah
  - scribbles of the **doodle demon**
    - all over my high school notes---sometimes "saying" said notes
    - wings optional
    - occasionally ~3-D~
    - horns like Mickey ears---never overlap
  - side view of Zero, nothing noted
  - fullbody of the, uh, "**This Thing**"
    - original species do not steal
    - from a RP that never happened
    - based vaguely on eel-horse-raptor
    - "advanced" society?? vague kangaroo inspiration? idk
    - claws should be filed for easier tool use

I'm disappointed that I seem to have forgotten the eel-horse-raptor's terrible giant front teeth somewhere along the line.
