  Two square compositions, silhouettes on black.
  - Left: Nico from the front, shoulder's raised; Tara's hand is on his neck, which fades white from the touch.
  - Right: Ivy from the side, mouth open in a frown; Tara floats upside-down, hands running through Ivy's hair.

Based on the idea of Tara coming back as a ghost, which is not a thing that happens, but is fun to think about.
