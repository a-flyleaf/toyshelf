> I don’t think I’ve drawn a proper Slade fullbody since… ever? Yeah, ever. His [original reference]({%include url.html%}/art/sladeref) is colored lineart and since then it’s just been headshots. Wanted to mess with a lineless fur technique (and actually use [a photo reference](https://www.twincities.com/2020/02/01/soucheray-keep-an-eye-out-for-the-wily-urban-coyote-worked-up-and-looking-for-love/)\* as closely as possible for a change, markings notwithstanding) and he was a good test subject >:3
