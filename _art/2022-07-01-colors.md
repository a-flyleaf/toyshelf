  Duplicate wolf-skull fullbodies; an attempt to figure out a palette, including grayscale versions and a potential color guide. Notes transcribed below:
  - Keith Voltron/Lucas & Ethan PKMN: stands out---too much?
  - monochrome: OK colors, kinda dull
  - Spicy! Yes: warm hues only. overkill?
  - burgundy: interesting... no purble tho.
  - <em style="font-style:normal;text-transform:uppercase;">Hmmm</em> ok still not Satisfied but noticing A Pattern: same colors, same places
    - [hair and pants can have] similar values? but not always
    - 5 [outfit] colors: jacket + shoes, accent, trim, shirt + socks, pants
    - +2 [base] colors: skin [and] hair; [the] mask need not be exact, just Light
  - no matter how many palettes I mess with I keep goin back to this one... [red jacket, blue pants, dark shirt, light accents]
  - [next to a blue outfit with a suspicious resemblance to another character of mine] ...wait.
  
  At the end of all these: a silly doodle of wolf-skull lying T-posed on the ground, with all sorts of hues scribbled in. *girl help* (do u love hte colors of the character)
