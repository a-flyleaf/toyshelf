Zero's part of [a full Isos sketchdump](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/Giant-Isos-Sketchdump-325546208). I can't find the original file for this so the quality's kinda mediocre.

<abbr title="if I remember correctly">IIRC</abbr> the green used to look transparent or semi-transpaent on deviantArt's layout at the time. RIP.
