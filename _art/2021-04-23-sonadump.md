  <b>ENA"sona" concepts</b>
  - 3/26: the original idea, three slightly different versions
  
  Everything else is from 4/23.
  - "You again." In which the "sona" returns, based on the "sociable/apathy" duality.
    - "sociable = organic---<em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">or</em> robotic because it's less authentic/on script?
  - Assorted takes on the head shape. Hair could be a mess all over? Some heads remind me of [the Shepherd](https://enajoelg.fandom.com/wiki/The_Shepherd) and the [Kast](https://kast.gg/) logo. Head shouldn't be too wide; in the right-half-only mode, white out the eye?
  - Running with the Kast-logo just for fun, "this isn't a 'sona' anymore but Neatâ„¢!". Could be a monster form? Body built of shapes like 3D modeling bones?
  - More takes on the hair.
  - Fun with limbs. "normal sleeves + Hell Hands?"
  - Process of an asymmetrical body plan.
  - "anime hair-lookin ass...", and the body plan with clothing.
  - Last but certainly not least, a finished drawing of the character in both modes, seemingly standing on a 2000s Windows desktop. Both versions are adjacent to "sticky notes" and a program window:
    - sociable: "May I help you?" note, "Hello!" on the window
    - apathetic: "Bug off." window, "Go away..." in the note.
