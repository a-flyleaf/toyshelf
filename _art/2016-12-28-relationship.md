caption: A spotlight fades down in grayscale on the disaster duo, each subtly colored monochrome, neither smiling. Ivy's eyes are cloesd, one hand on Nico's shoulder and the other around his raised wrist; Nico's slouched on a chair, making a finger-gun motion at his head. His other hand is balled in a fist.
