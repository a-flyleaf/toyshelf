  Three sketches of Dodder in different art styles, with full-color headshots and notes below:
  - <b>super stylized/angular</b>
    - bold lines (or lineless) w/ flat colors? little or no shading
    - almost caricature-ish
    - cartoony haha funney
  - <b>"default" style ig</b> (semi-realism??)
    - probably best with loose lines, cel shading or *some* blending
    - defined features, mostly 3D but liberties taken for silhouette and/or expressiveness
    - seriously idk how you'd model some of these hair/eye shapes glhf
  - <b>close as I'm gonna get to "realism" without dying</b>
    - no flats or lines we blend like real <u>pain</u>ters (except here lol)
    - if you know how to make realism exprssive and not uncanny <abbr title="hit me up">HMU</abbr>
    - paying more attention to facial planes 👍
    - \[side note]: <em style='font-style:normal;text-transform:uppercase;'>why did I choose mr oval eyes for this</em>
  
  <p style='margin:1em 0;'><strong style='font-weight:normal;text-transform:uppercase;'>Also</strong> since sometimes you can't tell if it's the <em style='font-style:normal;text-transform:uppercase;'>art style</em> or an <em style='font-style:normal;text-transform:uppercase;'>intentional feature</em>, have some <s>quick n lazy</s> <strong>~design notes~</strong></p>
  - long face with prominent "bumps" (forehead, nose, chin)
  - wavy long hair with visible hairline, stylized more blocky than round
  - <em style='font-style:normal;text-transform:uppercase;'>very wide eyes</em>; they see all, know [jack shit](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/723/113/0c0.png)
  - \*I usually pay attention to eyebrow & ear shapes too but for now we ignore it, you get the gist
  - unnaturally yellow (mustard...) hair + godawful tan
    - hair would probably be toned down for realism. tan? <span style='display:inline-block;'>¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯</span>

> Self-explanatory, I think <span style="display:inline-block;">¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯</span> First sketch trio (minus the lil circles) has been sitting in my folders for uhhhhh -checks- 2 years now (January 17, 2019…), and since I’ve been thinking about the style thing a lot lately, might as well finally post it.
