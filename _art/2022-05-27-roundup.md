  Mostly-unrelated scribbles scattered around a canvas; noted, "and last but certainly not least [in the roundup], **old character takeover zone** (AKA mainly her [Ava] but the core duo's here too)"
  
  ### what even is canon anymore with these people
  Single-page comic of Ivy and Ava (both adults) sitting across from each other at some kind of dining establishment. "So," Ava says, "let me get this straight..."
  - Ava, continued: "You've devoted the last..." (She counts on her fingers.) "...three years---"  
    "Four."  
    "<em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">Four years</em> and counting to this guy..."
  - Ivy doesn't look impressed. Ava, continuing: "...who, by <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">your own</em> admission, is 'a lazy, demotivated slob' who's 'unlikely to change.'
  - Ava, meanwhile, is doing very amused chinhands. "<em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">Why,</em>" she says, "pray tell, would you <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">do that</em>."
  - Beat. Ivy stares dryly as ever.
  - Then takes a sip. "I liked you better as a girl scout."  
    "Hey," Ava says, "<em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">you</em> came to <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">me</em>, lady."
  
  ### untitled follow-up
  Nico's at the table now.
  - Ava: "Your girlfriend's a real piece of work, huh?"
  - Nico slams the table. "<strong style="text-transform:uppercase;font-weight:normal;">Yes.</strong> But she does it for <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">love</em>."
  - Beat. They stare at each other for a moment.
  - Nico reclines and makes finger guns. "<em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">Psyche.</em>"  
    Ava, raising her hands: "You almost had me there...!"  
    "<em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">Ha</em>."
  
  ### Ava diagram
  Circle of 2012!Ava → "uh-oh!" → two paths, both 2017: in one, "is adult", and in the other, "is ghost." Captioned "**Schrödinger's Ava** (<i>n.</i>): a character who is simultaneously alive and dead, until (unless) Canon™ kicks in"

  ### more untitled Avas
  - Messy, bright newspaper-comic-style 2017!Ava at a booth titled "unqualified non-psychiatric 'help'"---"free!". (A homage to [Lucy of <i>Peanuts</i> fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_van_Pelt#Psychiatric_booth).)
  - And a scribble of 2017!Ava in a different getup. Side note: "This part [waist up] is OK, not sure on this [the rest]. more of a skirt/dress person iirc...."
