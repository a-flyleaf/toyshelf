  Sketch-silhouette portraits on black, most in front view, featuring the disaster crew in their associated and otherwise-symbolic colors.
  - Nico is sprawled as if dead, vomitting red and white tobacco flowers. Cyan/white leaves and vines grow from below his ribs and wrap around his neck & arm.
  - Ivy's arms are crossed over her head. A DNA-esque motif in cyan, pink, and white wraps around her arms and torso, red around the neck, golden strands crawling up from the abdomen.
  - Dodder makes a "shh" hand, a fuzzy white halo around his head. He holds a pitcher plant, and a larger one is silhouetted in the background against a gradient from yellow-green to purple.
  - Levi, the ony one with eyes (blank white), pulls violently at flowers; one hand grips white lillies[? I forgot what they were supposed to be tbh] while the other rips up a venus flytrap. Morning glory flowers frame the corners, and a dusting of golden-yellow "hairs" covers Levi from the neck down.
  - Ava clasps her hands as if in prayer, "bones" and highlights in red. She wears a thick choker with an upside-down cross, and a dandelion in her hair. Framed against [what I think is supposed to be] a giant pitcher plant leaf (but it could also be a heart) on yellow-green.
  - Tara's arms are crossed over her shoulders, like a mummy. On the left ripple bold lines in cyan and yellow-gold; on the rihgt, thinner strands of neon green (and some white) surround her. Tara herself is rendered mostly white, hands fading to yellow and yellow-green.
  - Vexus holds a smartphone in front of his face; it and his outlines are rendered yellow-green, a white dot in the center for the camera. Other than a solid red hood, his sleeves and the background use an intertwining scribbly motif; sleeves in yellow-gold and purple, background in cyan and pink.

Levi's pose is riffing on the art for ["Novocaine"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdpwOLSKMLA). Originally posted [as a photoset](https://aflyleaf3.wordpress.com/2018/03/22/back-on-my-eyestrain-hell-in-a-void-bs/).
