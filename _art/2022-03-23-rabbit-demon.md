  "It's Free Dynamic Real Estate" ft. <i>[Ygbtdm](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/ygbtdm/)</i> characters Addison and Kay Lin, a four-panel comic with gratuitous copypaste.
  - Addison, holding a cross in Kay Lin's direction: "<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Begone, demon</span>"
  - Kay Lin looks over at the aptly-named hellrabbit. Addison, from offscreen: "<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">No, not you! *You!*</span>"
  - Kay Lin points at the rabbit blankly. Addison: "<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">I said it's not that... thing! It's *you!*</span>"
  - Kay Lin points at herself. Addison: "<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Yeah. Yeah, *you!* I meant you!</span>"
