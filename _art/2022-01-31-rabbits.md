  Design notes for the hellrabbit, along with some sillier interactions.
  - Includes a step-by-step for its head from the side:
    1. start with a circle
    1. weird shape juts out (upper jaw)
    1. long ears and bigass eye
    1. add human nose, flat molars, and front teeth (2 big front, and on both sides 1 curved back and 1 pointy; the four in front are all very flat)
    1. jaw is like an arm, plus a connecting line at the "elbow"; it has 2 "fingers" and 1 "thumb," and doesn't close
  - Notes on the rest of it:
    - neck is often "hunched"
    - body is like, Very Stretchy Human
    - overall stance may vary (crouched, kinda-standing on four legs; god forbid it goes biped)
    - forearm shoulder juts forward
    - elbow lines up with ribcage
    - hand can rotate but not far forward
    - fingers rotate way more, forward and back, and the non-thumb digits tend to cluster
    - leg is... leg. Big Foot
    - can walk flat-footed or on toes---length is fudged
  - All on one canvas: a hyperdetailed head, a hopping rabbit ("yee haw"), and a content rabbit with its jaw clamped on a human character (Addison)'s arm. "I," says Addison, making a thumbs up, "love nature." "**this layer is unholy**"
  - A rabbit breathes heavily, shaking and drooling, as another person (Kay Lin) sticks an arm right through the gap. "See?" she says. "Nothing all the way through---" And from offscreen: "<strong style="text-transform:uppercase;">Kay Lin <em>what. No</em></strong>"
  - Yet another person licks an ice cream bunny, which is melting. *Delectable.*
  - "Now now," says Addison, head nearly enclosed by a rabbit, "I think there's been a *misunderstanding*---"
  - Last but not least, a rabbit labeled "FireAlpaca" looks down wide-eyed at a bunch of acorns, labeled "100+ layers right out the gate."

Snippet of [a monthly art roundup, story edition](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/ygbtdm/gallery/roundups/2022-01). Ironically that's one of the longest roundups thus far (as of May 2022), yet this is one of the shortest rabbit-snips.
