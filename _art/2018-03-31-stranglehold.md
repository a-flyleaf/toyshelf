  Younger versions of Ivy and Nico in rather intense poses: Ivy has one hand over one of Nico's eyes, the other over his mouth, and stares grimly at the viewer. Nico grabs at her lower wrist, while his other hand points a finger gun at his own head. A string wraps around their hands, flowing around fingers and wrists, intertwined.
  
  Two versions, both in flat, solid colors with gradients.
  - Black background: Ivy is cyan, only slightly faded, and Nico is bright green save for his hands, which fade into light red where the string is attached. The strig itself is red.
  - Red background: Both characters are white; a [chromatic aberration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration)-esque effect has been applied, rendering Nico's hands cyan.

(Fun fact: The concept got roughly recycled [for fanart](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/--765056806). The dynamics are very different, and yet!!)
