  A big wall of art, featuring Ava, Vexus, and stray little cameos.
  
  ### Ava sketches
  - speech bubble: "First! LOL xD\*"
    - side note: "\*a non-small amount of this character's traits have been recycled for people I'm actually Using. [traits] including the hair thing. she has no excuse for the old internet slang though."
  - "never figured out how this side/angle [of her hair, when she's facing right] works..."
  - "white eyes of Homestuck deadness?", pointing to a doodle of Ava shining a flashlight under her chin and raising a hand all spooky. No detail in her eyes.

  ### Vexus scribbles
  He looks grumpy as usual in all of these.
  - "mouth curls up to the right (viewer's left)"
  - "giant headphones of 'no talky'?"
  - The canvas also includes a sketch-poster-concept of him and ghost!Ava, looking warily at something offscreen; Ava points while Vexus shines a flashlight at it.

  ### "indulgent crossover nonsense machine continues to go *brr*"
  A scribbly little height comparison featuring two characters from another project of mine: [Joce](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/ygbtdm/cast/joce) (>23, 6\'4\") and [Kay Lin](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/ygbtdm/cast/kay-lin) (presumably An Adult, 4\'3\").
  
  Tara (15, also 6\'4\") grins down at Kay Lin and offers a handshake: "How's the weather down there?". To her right, Ava (also 15, 4\'6\") makes a fistpump; "<strong style="font-weight:normal;text-transform:uppercase;">Finally</strong> someone <em style="font-style:normal;text-transform:uppercase;">older</em> I got beat!"

  ### untitled sketch
  A bigger, more polished version of the poster concept, both sketchy and (still roughly) rendered. In this one, Ava's smiling; Vexus is more uncertain than angry.

Snippets from [a monthly art roundup](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/roundup-05-2021-focus-pingpong-month-881268597). All but the last two are from the 11th; had to fudge the date for backend site generation reasons.
