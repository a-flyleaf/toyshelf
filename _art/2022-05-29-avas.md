  Assorted drawings of Ava, both versions. Two versions of the overall canvas: one with overlay and other effects resembling a dusty old film, and the other without.

> I feel like Ava here could use a redesign, in part because some of her traits (both visual and otherwise) have since been reverse-Frankensteined into some of my other characters. Her adult version’s outfit never partiiiicularly fit; she’d probably have quite a bit more jewelry and other shiny trinkets if I could be bothered to draw/remember them consistently. On the other hand, it’s not like any of this gang has a dedicated canon or anything anyway (besides all being ???interconnected, to some degree, I guess), so… heck it? <span style="display:inline;block;">:D</span>
