Snippet from [a monthly art roundup](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/roundup-10-2022-gray-gray-everywhere-941712138), with fuller sizes of the scrapped sketches that I still like several months later (July 2023, when uploading this). Includes inspiration from the game <i style="text-transform:uppercase;">Off</i>, particularly [this character](https://off.fandom.com/wiki/Japhet), and [a gif that I saw long before knowing what the hell it was from](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/homestuck#wh4t-now).
