Originally posted [on deviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/doodle-demon-585537547), minus the <i style="text-transform:uppercase;">OFF</i> version for some reason. The upsized pixel art is bigger than the rest because I didn't downscale the sketch precisely, but I wanted to keep the pixel-square resolution exact here. (Maybe that's why I didn't include it earlier...?)
