  Full-color four-page comic, titled "**The Guardian**." Description focuses more on narrative than exact panel-by-panel specifics.
  
  - A child runs through the streets, holding some type of gem close. They turn into an alley---and notice something. A monster is eating the trash.
  - The monster (the eel-horse-raptor, "ehr") is surprised and snarls. The child is unphased and reaches out playfully; ehr shrinks back, not sure how to handle the situation. Then the kid reaches for some food in the trash, shoving the ehr aside.
  - "Oh, *there* you are!" An adult stands in the alley now, arms outstretched. "Come back now, child, I won't hurt you. You know it's not safe to play with monsters like that." But the kid, suddenly scared, hides behind the ehr, suddenly scared.
  - The adult raises his chin. He's wearing a belt with slots for three colorful stones; one is missing. "Step back, creature," he says. "This child is a thief. He's under my protection, and I'd hate to take him back---forcibly, that is."
  - The ehr glares back at the child. "Besides," continues the adult, "who's to say he's not trying to steal from *you* now?" Teeth bared, the ehr swings its head towards the child, who cowers---
  - ---but the child is placed on the ehr's back. The adult reaches for a gun but is swiped back by the ehr, who rears like a horse.
  - Child safely on its back, the ehr gallops into the night.
  - The child is uncertain. "He's--- he's right, you know." They're holding tight, but looking back. "I shouldn't be out here on my own, I'm just some stupid little---"
  - The ehr glances back. Sympathetic.
  - "Thank you..." And with that, they disappear into the darkness.
