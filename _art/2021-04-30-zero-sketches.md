  ### 20211/4/20, modified from original roundup
  Assorted sketches of Zero:
  - Two versions of a fullbody, both playing with cyan markings on the wings.
  - Simple side view headshot, with a closeup on the feather gradient (cyan to pink).
  - Fullbody side view comparison: current anatomy, front claws turned outward slightly; and one "based on [the] original adopt by [GlitchedBat](https://www.deviantart.com/glitchedbat)" which also has "toe beans" (paws).
  - Below the comparison, headshots of the two versions. "Who are you?" asks Zero; "I'm you," says the original Zero, "but older and less blinding."

  Written side notes:
  - FTR the record I still have the original adoptable file saved. buried in folders from <u>2012</u>. <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">wack</em>
  - usually I edit out the palette squares but what the hell, fits the sketchiness
  - (this [headshot canvas] looks a lil awkward because I figure out the layout as I go along and forgot a doodle, oops.)
  
  Those last two notes are more relevant to the roundup file as a whole, but figured I'd transcribe them anyway.

Snippet from [a monthly roundup](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/sketchdump-roundup-04-2021-Long-Mode-878015249), all from May 20th; had to fudge the date for backend site generation reasons.
