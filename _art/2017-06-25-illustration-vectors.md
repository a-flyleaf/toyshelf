  Three vector illustraitions featuring the eel-horse-raptor (ehr) and a person, original and final.
  - The ehr spots a human in the woods.
    - Final version uses more vibrant, blue-ish hues.
  - The human, smiling, gives the ehr a pet.
    - Original version has a more detailed silhouette of the human; the final reverts to a simpler "oval with eyes" shape to match the first better. Colors have also been tweaked in the final.
  - The ehr drags the human underwater, where other monsters in similar colors await.
    - In the final, it's clearer that the ehr is actually dragging the human under.

Assignment: three sequential illustrations. Also see [the sketch versions]({%include url.html%}/art/illustration-sketches). (The timeline's a bit weird because of how I set the files up (both originals were last edited on the 18th, and finals on the 25th) but I'm just gonna leave it split by polish anyway.
