  **Jan. 26 2018** species brainstormin & other scribbles: concept sketches and other headshots featuring a funky mammalian species. Notes transcribed below:
  - [ear] hairs curl inward to attract sound?
  - [where the front legs of the first sketch would be] <strong style="font-weight:normal;text-transform:uppercase;">wait no quadruped</strong>
  - thin fur?
  - double nostril?
  - claws filed down for modern convenience
  - no animal sameface in my lobby \[comparison of [Zero]({%include url.html%}/misc#zero), [the eel-horse-raptor]({%include url.html%}/misc#ehr), and this thing]
  - ...OK maybe a *little* sameface

This thing is effectively a standalone design but I kinda just wanted an excuse to share these.
