  Extremely red sketch: Some guy, shocked, gets pulled into a kiss by Nico, who's glaring defiantly at the viewer with a little smirk. His free hand is flipping the bird.
  
  Below that, an uncolored sketch of them both at a laptop. The guy, Flynn, looks like he's about to have a heart attack; Nico, however, slams the table and cackles.

First sketch is titled "<b>for my gf</b>"; <i>Nico and [Flynnegan](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/shriblets/2019-05-wiki/#current) bathed in red, Nico won't be sleepin' in bed~</i>

The second sketch was drawn first but I thought this order looked funnier. What's on the laptop? Were these even supposed to go together?? The world may never know.
