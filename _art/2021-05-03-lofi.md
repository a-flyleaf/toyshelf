caption: |-
  Semi-painted sketch of a warm sunset, bathed in purple and red. In the foreground, backs to the viewer, Vexus and Levi sit. Vexus is hunched over, arms folded; Levi squats on his heels, using Vexus' back as an armrest and facing down at him. At the sides of the canvas, vague curtains are pulled aside.
  
  In the top left corner is a tiny palette box, and the handwritten text "another [sd_bbb lofi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPP-XEgOg-0) drawing... the Vibes,"
