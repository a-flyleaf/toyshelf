  Four headshots of Nico and Ivy, two of each in very different art styles.
  - Two are extremely simple, just black lines on white; based on the illustrations in *Diary of a Wimpy Kid*. Ivy's portraits reads "If I see this irl, Nico is dead, but look @ my stupid perf. eyebrows"
  - The other two are anime-esque sketches with abstracted, textured colors. Ivy's features blue, cyan, traces of yellow, and a vibrant red "shadow"; Nico's engulfs him in murky reddish-green, with neon green highlights and a streak of red through the face.
