  Traditional sketch and color-blocked concept of an unfinished piece: Ivy, wearing a loose dress[? I do not remember what it was supposed to be], holds Nico, who lies back limp in her kneeling lap. Stringy scribbles surround them; in the colored version, they're yellow-gold, with some around Ivy and white strands wrapping around Nico.

Concept that I never got around to finishing. Based blatantly on [Michelangelo's <i>Piet√†</i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet%C3%A0_(Michelangelo)); I vaaaaguely feel like I was also ripping off the pose from another similar drawing, but unfortunately have zero memory of what it was.
