  Three lineless illustrations featuring the eel-horse-raptor.
  - fist: Foggy forest; a human in a clearing holds out a map. The eel-horse-raptor watches in the foreground.
  - second: Inside an aquarium, the eel-horse-raptor sticks its head over a caution tape, curious.
  - third: A person stands at the entrance to an overgrown alleyway; a poster on the wall warns of nuclear activity. From the darkness, the eel-horse-raptor flashes a toothy grin.

The file name (and memory) indicates that I churned these out the morning of class, as one does. I forget what the exact requirements were because I'm not 100% sure these are supposed to go together; we were studying sequential art and illustrative storytelling, <abbr title="if I remember correctly">iirc</abbr>.
