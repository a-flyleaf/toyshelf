  Three colored sketch illustraitions featuring the eel-horse-raptor (ehr) and a person; original versions and post-crit revisions of the latter two (the first didn't change).
  - The ehr spots a human in the woods.
  - The human, smiling, gives the ehr a pet.
    - Original version has a more detailed silhouette of the human; the revision reverts to a simpler "oval with eyes" shape to match the first better. There's (supposed to be) water in the background now, too.
  - The ehr drags the human underwater, where other monsters in similar colors await.
    - In the revision, it's clearer that the ehr is actually dragging the human under.

Assignment: three sequential illustrations. Also see [the vector versions]({%include url.html%}/art/illustration-vectors). (The timeline's a bit weird because of how I set the files up (both originals were last edited on the 18th, and finals on the 25th) but I'm just gonna leave it split by polish anyway.
