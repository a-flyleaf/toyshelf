> This lizard is one of several designs I've had sitting around for ages for no apparent reason \o/ Recently contacted the original adoptable seller and got express permission to recycle him as an "original" character, so have a(nother) redesign. Still no guarantees I'll do anything with him, but he sure does exist all right!
