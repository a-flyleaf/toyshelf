  Zero trots along holding the original Pride flag. Faded in the background of the main image (and at full opacity below) are alternate versions featuring the nonbinary, aromantic, and asexual flags, with Zero recolored to match. All these flags (and more!) can be found [on Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Sexual_identity_symbols).

Originally posted [on deviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/lizard-said-gay-rights-918188545); this version includes full-opacity versions of the recolors.

> No wings because it made the flag area too busy, but what is Zero if not a very variable lizard.
