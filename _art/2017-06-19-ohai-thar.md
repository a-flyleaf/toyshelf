Assignment: edit a drawing (not sure if it *had* to be the chimera) into a photograph. I can't find the original photo source but I'm 99% sure it was free to use; at the time of writing (June 2022) a reupload exists [on this site](https://www.pxfuel.com/id/free-photo-oshyb). If that link breaks: Google suggests it's a picture of the "Hutan Berkabut" forest---about which I can find nothing in English.
