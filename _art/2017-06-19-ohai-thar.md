  Process sketches and final version of the eel-horse-raptor trotting in a misty forest. The ehr is drawn; the background is a photograph.

Assignment: edit a drawing (not sure if it *had* to be the chimera) into a photograph. I can't find the original picture source but I'm 99% sure it was free; a reupload exists at the time of writing [on this site](https://www.pxfuel.com/id/free-photo-oshyb), and if that link breaks it seems to be the "Hutan Berkabut" forest---about which I can find nothing in English.
