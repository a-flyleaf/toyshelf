  Ruined city.  
  "Find any survivors?" No response. "Goddamn."  
  There are hands in the rubble. *Well, no use crying over spilled...* But the speaker frowns. *Forget it.*
  
  The second person, holding a hat, watches the first walk away. "...And where are you going?"  
  "Home."  
  "But... your house...." It's all in shambles.
  
  "I said."  
  There's a dog sniffing around. The first person lifts a plank of wood, as if to hit it---
  
  <i>Crack!</i> The plank splits---  
  ---as it hits the ground. The first person threw it, and the dog runs after.  
  The second puts the hat on. "You play a mean game of fetch---"  
  *"Shh."*  
  The dog has reached the split.
  
  Gingerly the dog takes one part in its mouth.
  First person is on the move again. "---Wait," says hat person, "you're not---"  
  "I said," replies the first, "I'm going *home.*" They give the dog a little pat; its head is lifted, plank still in maw.
  
  The last "page" resembles a cover, which features the first person---who's now wearing a canine skull. There's space blocked out for a title but since there is no title there are only blocks.

A Thing, with no larger story attached, and not related to the project wolf-skull was designed for. So like, does this even qualify as the same character?? I just like the design <span style="display:inline-block;">ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ</span>
