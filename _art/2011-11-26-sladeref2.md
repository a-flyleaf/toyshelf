I completely forgot this existed, cool! Uses [this lineart](https://www.deviantart.com/kaylink/art/Coyote-Lineart-266853376). Effectively the same design as [the original]({%include url.html%}/art/sladeref) but with a less strong texture overlay. (...Assuming, of course, that the opacity translated across computers and versions of GIMP. It's very possible it didn't.)
