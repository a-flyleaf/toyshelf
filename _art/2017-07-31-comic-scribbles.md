  Assorted sketches and design notes of the eel-horse-raptor (ehr) and the humans that appear in its comic.
  - from class (lunch break): "tfw you realize you probably don't need to line in Illustrator and could'a been a <em style="font-style:normal;text-transform:uppercase;">lot</em> further along by now". Ehr is displeased.
  - ehr's head fin could be a subtle wave when neutral, jagged when alarmed.
  - ehr palette: mostly dark, cyan gradient on the limbs, fins, and gums. "[Exact colors vary]: grayish tongue, blue fin/eye undertones"
  - "former monster tamer? 'bucky' [nicknamed for buck teeth]"; nose tapers about midway through, "like Ren but sharp/round [lines] reversed"
  - kid's face is "wide & round"; "nose is more [triangular] than [round]; has a "tooth gap + one [tooth] missing"; and "a dinosaur kid for sure"
  - ehr headshot with a jagged ear edge and duller fraying at the fin; "I got shot," it says, while the caption indicates "old *gunshot* wounds, *not* animal-inflicted"
  - full-color bust of the monster tamer, much younger, with a chained three-eyed mammal mutant on his shoulders
