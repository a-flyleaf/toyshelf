  A looping animation based on the game [Friday Night Funkin](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/770371), in which characters compete in a sing-off with a pulsing speaker between. On the beat:
  - Nico jerks his head, kicks the ground, and flicks the mic.
  - Ivy taps her foot and clenches the mic, only slightly bobbing.
  - Vexus, who's sitting on the speaker, is bounced along like he's in a really bumpy car. Also slightly tilting his head & kicking his legs.
  - Ava, across from Nico and Ivy, taps her foot and tosses the mic.

> The background was an afterthought and there iiiissss no real story context (this is not remotely canonical, other than the general vibe of the idle animations being in-character), but I’ve been toying with this crew again lately and wanted to do something with those FNF-inspired sketches from the other week. Got the idea to throw in a couple kids to “finish” the scene and bada bing bada boom.
