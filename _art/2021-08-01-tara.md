  Four sketches of the same concept: fullbody of Tara, mildly disheveled, on a blue backdrop. Concept-variants are the original composition, a semi-painted color blocking, a headshot closeup, and more refined sketches of the hand (a collar dangling limply from one finger) and overall pose.

Snippet from [a monthly art roundup](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/roundup-07-2021-batteries-not-included-887517233). Initial sketches from July 14th; this page is dated to August 1st since 3 of 4 got colored directly on the roundup file.
