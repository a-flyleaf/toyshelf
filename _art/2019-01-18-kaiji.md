  - Left: Nico reclines lazily in the seat of a greenish, dingy subway.
  - Right: Two anime screenshots, both front views of a determined-looking guy, hand raised off to the side; one is from <i>Kaiji</i>, and the other is from [the "<b>100%</b> you are my fuckign girlfriend" meme](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/668/747/a7c.png). Below these is a sketch of Nico making a similar face+pose. It is very stupid.

Redraw from [part of the <i>Kaiji</i>\* credits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEHcjRpWV0s), and... whatever the right thing is, both from the same day. (\*I couldn't get into the series but the character resemblance kills me.)
