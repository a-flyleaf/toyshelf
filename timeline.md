Just for the heck of it, and also my own ease of reference.

- oldest of them all: doodle demon
	- "them all" does not include imaginary friends and other characters from childhood series
- pre-2011: Nightpath; first reference posted January this year
	- I *know* she preceded Slade but don't have a date on it :T
- 2010 December: Slade Auctor
	- <abbr title="if I remember correctly">iirc</abbr> I joined ’Souls and immediately went on vacation lmao, I associate him more with 2011. might not have had a Design™ until later anyway? that was posted in October 2011
- 2012: <b>disaster duo</b> via poké-protags Alex/Nate/Nathan and Ivy (name never changed)
	- Hugh and his sister later became Tara and Vexus
- 2012 August: Zero
- 2013: earliest sparks of what would eventually become <b><i>The Firebird Effect</i></b>, incl. earliest incarnations of Flynn & Ren (then nameless Flare grunts A and B; there was probably a C but they didn't stick around story-development-wise)

There was a big "creative hiatus" of sorts around here, where I drew mostly fanart and didn't write much (to memory, anyway). It's probably no coincidence that this is around when I was really into tumblr (social media! always a timesuck), was slogging through highschool (A Struggle), and other irl shit was going down too (the internet doesn't need to know).

Fortunately, at some point I picked up <i>TFE</i> again; possibly 2015-ish? It got redeveloped quite a bit before I started publishing the comic in mid-2016.

- 2016: earliest recorded appearances of "sawface"
	- "named" on the spot for ArtFight 2021
- 2017--8: revisited <b>disaster duo</b> (and Hugh/Tara and sister/Vexus); Nico renamed, spawned Ava, Levi, Dodder
- 2018 January: RP species
- mid-/late 2018: "sika" (sketches, have a google doc from April but <abbr title="can’t be assed">cba</abbr> to sketch-dig)
- late 2018: <b><i>404</i></b> (then untitled; offshoot of <i>DDLC</i> obesssion that started earlier in the year)
- 2018 December: permission granted to OC-ify Zero
- 2020: ENA phase
