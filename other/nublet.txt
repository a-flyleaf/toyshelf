[color=black][b]Questions[/b][/color]

[hex=#8459b2][i]Could we be friends/enemies?[/i][/hex]
[hex=#8989b6]Erm, sure...? I don't keep a list of friends/enemies, though; you're free to add me to yours, but don't expect to see your name on my profile any time soon.[/hex]

[hex=#8459b2][i]Are you on any sites other than Wolf-Haven and [url=http://NightAuctor.deviantART.com]deviantART[/url]?[/i][/hex]
[hex=#8989b6]At the moment I'm only active on three sites: the two mentioned above and a clicking site called PokeFarm (Nightpath).[/hex]

[hex=#8459b2][i]What do you look like in Equipment View without equipment?[/i][/hex]
[hex=#8989b6][url=http://i.imgur.com/t3EWV.gif]This (click)[/url].[/hex]

[hex=#8459b2][i]Can you donate for me?[/i][/hex]
[hex=#8989b6]No; I'm too young to donate. I got my custom in a giveaway by the lovely Seasonal. (This is [i]not[/i] a signal for you to go ask her for a free donation!) Furthermore, I'd recommend you not ask this to anyone else; others are a lot less polite when answering this sort of question.[/hex]

[hex=#8459b2][i]Can you invite me to your pack (Reverie)?[/i][/hex]
[hex=#8989b6]Unfortunately, the answer is no. You'll have to PM Rikkah, the pack's only active Alpha, and if you really want to join you might be able to bait her by NOT calling her Rik and promising to be active on the pack forums.[/hex]

[hex=#8459b2][i]Would you mind a random message?[/i][/hex]
[hex=#8989b6]Nope, so fire away! ^^ Of course, you should have a topic in mind, because I'm terrible at starting conversations.[/hex]

[hex=#8459b2][i]Will you be my mate?[/i][/hex]
[hex=#8989b6]Lolno... not for now, anyway. PM me; maybe we can chat or something. Roleplaying would be nice, too, but as of now I still have to flesh out Nightpath's character so I won't be doing much any time soon.[/hex]

[hex=#8459b2][i]Is your design symmetric?[/i][/hex]
[hex=#8989b6]Yes, my design is completely symmetrical; I have no scars or anything.[/hex]

[hex=#8459b2][i]Do you read Warriors (by Erin Hunter)?[/i][/hex]
[hex=#8989b6]Sorta. I'm not obsessed with getting out every single new book as it's put on the shelf. And yes, Nightpath is a warrior name. Because I can't think of anything better, it'll stay that way.[/hex]

[hex=#8459b2][i]Why do you call this part of your profile "Questions" instead of FAQs like all the other people?[/i][/hex]
[hex=#8989b6]Two reasons: 1. Because I don't usually like trends (starting a blog excluded), and 2. I've never been asked some of these questions before, but thought I'd stick 'em up here just in case someone happens to ask.[/hex]

[hex=#8459b2][i]ZOMG UR MEAN!!!1!!![/i][/hex]
[hex=#8989b6]ZOMG THAT'S NOT A QUESTION!!!one!!![/hex]

Actually, if I attacked you, go ahead and send me hate mail. I'm not going to reply and will be reporting you for harassment. Then, once you are dealt with, I will laugh hysterically. So please hate me for attacking you via the Internet. ^^
On the flipside, I don't care if you attack me. I have some extra DP on me anyway, so if you want it, come get it![/hex]

[color=black][b]ROLEPLAYS[/b][/color]
[hex=#8989b6]I don't do Advanced roleplays here anymore; Beginner-Intermediate is what I do on Wolf-Haven. All I request is no chatspeak, and decent punctuation/spelling.
You request, you start. Forum is preferred.

I'm [i]finally[/i] in the process of making a roleplaying bio for Nightpath, but in the mean time you won't be seeing the most fleshed-out character in our roleplays.
Finally, I don't do "dirty" roleplaying, [i]especially[/i] since it's not even allowed. As for anthro/feral, I haven't done anthro since I was a little kid and didn't know the meaning of the word "anthromorphic" but I'm willing to try. Feral is still my preference, however.[/hex]

[color=black][b]MATE?[/b][/color]
[hex=#8989b6]Nightpath lost her first mate a few months ago (presumably due to hunters capturing him) and she's reluctant to get into another relationship, especially since when they met they were still young and she jumped into it very quickly. If you want to try to win this girl's heart you're going to have to roleplay it out... and no, she doesn't respond well to wolves who think that they're the smexiest thing alive. Male is preferred but it could go either way as far as gender is concerned.[/hex]
