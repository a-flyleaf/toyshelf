Just for the heck of it, and also my own ease of reference.

- oldest of them all: [doodle demon]({%include url.html%}/misc#demon)
	- "them all" does not include imaginary friends and other characters from childhood series

	- <abbr title="if I remember correctly">iirc</abbr> I joined ’Souls and immediately went on vacation lmao, I associate him more with 2011. might not have had a Design™ until later anyway? ref was posted in October 2011
- 2012: <b>disaster duo</b> via poké-protags [Alex/Nate/Nathan]({%include url.html%}/disaster-crew/nico) and [Ivy]({%include url.html%}/disaster-crew/ivy) (name never changed)
	- Hugh and his sister also got some crumbs of development
- 2012 August: [Zero]({%include url.html%}/art/zero-isos)
- 2013: earliest sparks of what would eventually become <b><i>The Firebird Effect</i></b>, including the faintest outlines of [Flynn & Ren]({%include url.html%}/misc#roommates) (then nameless Flare grunts A and B; there was probably a C but that one didn't stick around story-development-wise)

There was a big "creative hiatus" for the next couple years or so, where I drew mostly fanart and didn't write much (to memory, anyway). It's probably no coincidence that, meanwhile, I was really into tumblr (social media! always a timesuck), was slogging through highschool (A Struggle), and other irl shit was going down too.

At some point I picked up <i>TFE</i> again, possibly around 2015-ish? It got redeveloped quite a bit before I [started publishing the comic](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/projects/tfe) in mid-2016.

- 2016: earliest recorded appearances of ["sawface"]({%include url.html%}/misc#sawface)

	- renamed Nate/Nathan to <i>Nico</i>
	- spawned [Ava]({%include url.html%}/disaster-crew/ava), [Levi]({%include url.html%}/disaster-crew/levi), and [Dodder]({%include url.html%}/disaster-crew/dodder)

- mid-/late 2018: "sika" (sketches, have a google doc from April but <abbr title="can’t be assed">cba</abbr> to sketch-dig)
	- found in 4/27, 8/15, and 9/9
	- after revisiting the doc (and reading [an overview of the story it's based on](https://junjiitomanga.fandom.com/wiki/Lingering_Farewell)) I don't like this enough to put here in full, but keeping the note for my own reference anyway

## "sika"
At one point in 2018 I read [Junji Ito's <i>Fragments of Horror</i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragments_of_Horror) and got the idea of a story set in Japan with that kind of ~vibe. Something like that?? Shit, dude, it's been years, I don't remember much. I think it centered on this person who died and then reappeared as a deer-cryptid, slowly transforming over the course of the story until running off for good at the end. Something something grief metaphor. It was almost definitely based directly off the plotline in one of the <i>Fragments</i> stories.

Anyway they're mostly here because the "typical straight-haired Asian + long face" vibe kinda reminded me of [a much more developed character from an actual Project™](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/ygbtdm/cast/kay-lin), which is a total coincidence but I thought that was funny. Also, I keep forgetting where the sketches are <span style="display:inline-block;">>:V</span>

- p much just sketchdump scribs, studies not included
