Just for the heck of it, and also my own ease of reference.

- oldest of them all: [doodle demon]({%include url.html%}/misc#demon)
	- "them all" does not include imaginary friends and other characters from childhood series
- pre-2011: [Nightpath]({%include url.html%}/misc#nightpath); first reference posted January this year
	- I *know* she preceded Slade but don't have a date on it :T
- 2010 December: [Slade Auctor]({%include url.html%}/misc#slade)
	- <abbr title="if I remember correctly">iirc</abbr> I joined ’Souls and immediately went on vacation lmao, I associate him more with 2011. might not have had a Design™ until later anyway? ref was posted in October 2011
- 2012: <b>disaster duo</b> via poké-protags [Alex/Nate/Nathan]({%include url.html%}/disaster-crew/nico) and [Ivy]({%include url.html%}/disaster-crew/ivy) (name never changed)
	- Hugh and his sister also got some crumbs of development
- 2012 August: [Zero]({%include url.html%}/art/zero-isos)
- 2013: earliest sparks of what would eventually become <b><i>The Firebird Effect</i></b>, including the faintest outlines of [Flynn & Ren]({%include url.html%}/misc#roommates) (then nameless Flare grunts A and B; there was probably a C but that one didn't stick around story-development-wise)

There was a big "creative hiatus" for the next couple years or so, where I drew mostly fanart and didn't write much (to memory, anyway). It's probably no coincidence that, meanwhile, I was really into tumblr (social media! always a timesuck), was slogging through highschool (A Struggle), and other irl shit was going down too.

At some point I picked up <i>TFE</i> again, possibly around 2015-ish? It got redeveloped quite a bit before I [started publishing the comic](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/projects/tfe) in mid-2016.

- 2016: earliest recorded appearances of ["sawface"]({%include url.html%}/misc#sawface)
	- "named" on the spot for ArtFight 2021

	- renamed Nate/Nathan to <i>Nico</i>
	- spawned [Ava]({%include url.html%}/disaster-crew/ava), [Levi]({%include url.html%}/disaster-crew/levi), and [Dodder]({%include url.html%}/disaster-crew/dodder)

- mid-/late 2018: ["sika"]({%include url.html%}/misc#sika) (sketches, have a google doc from April but <abbr title="can’t be assed">cba</abbr> to sketch-dig)

sketches from 4/27, 8/15, and 9/9 (all 2018). moved description to actual misc page, but otherwise decided against publishing (again) because I still think the design kinda slaps and don't want to ~release~ it just yet
