newhell stuffs: update actual page(s), tagging n captions n shit
combine ygbtdm minor characters to one page, hellrabbit+wolfskull both; re-tag accordingly
	also fix/check links from both misc and about; for misc, have a span with the wolf-skull id
split both art page & assets folder by year, this is fuckign unwieldy
2023 artstuffs (scrounge the collection, there's stuff)

	since everyone is characters for now start by mass find+replacing the existing variable; site can stay as-is, just add "mine," and it can be backend only
