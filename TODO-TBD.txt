[2023 at some point]
- combine ygbtdm minor characters to one page, hellrabbit+wolfskull both; re-tag accordingly
	- also fix/check links from both misc and about; for misc, have a span with the wolf-skull id
- split art page by year, this is fuckign unwieldy (+so's the assets folder, but that generally doesn't need to be revisited! it's fine as a dumping grounds)
- 2023 artstuffs (scrounge the collection, there's stuff)
- https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/whole-lotta-busts-953061845 < forgot this, just use the full thing with no fades. and uh, on that note I will need to redo my tag links LMAO; characters, roundup tag would be useful (for my own ref really), site as a tag...
	- since everyone is characters for now start by mass find+replacing the existing variable; site can stay as-is, just add "mine," and it can be backend only


[2025-01-06] disaster-crew extra pages (links & timeline) can.. go... somewhere. eventually. maybe add a "journals" section (called smthn else) for text-based stuff like that

[2025-01-25] there's a zero page wip now wheee
