[2023 at some point]
- combine ygbtdm minor characters to one page, hellrabbit+wolfskull both; re-tag accordingly
	- also fix/check links from both misc and about; for misc, have a span with the wolf-skull id

# 2025
[1/06] disaster-crew extra pages (links & timeline) can.. go... somewhere. eventually. maybe add a "journals" section (called smthn else) for text-based stuff like that

[1/25] there's a zero page wip now wheee

[2/18] really *really* gotta futz with the tag system because the links are Not correct... maybe have some site data for generating gallery pages, and only link to those if the pages Exist? (see dragonotes dragon pages for the "check page for data in other array" thing.) much much MUCH easier than maintaining them all manually....
