The setting hasn't been developed a whole lot yet, so for now infer what you will from here.

- Some (most?) people are normal <i>Homo sapiens</i>, but there are also very much not-normal ??demons, or something, somewhere, and maybe not even in this world. Might be a cartoon-type deal where this difference is never really questioned, might be relevant.
- Base of the "normal" world is ~~my forever default~~ Modern American City™, or somewhere in that territory. But maybe an altered version with less modern technology? Not sure yet.

## stuff that happens
Behold, an utter dearth of [names](cast)!

### no exposition speedrun
- A wise old guy, the previous (and long-time) holder of the $powers, is on his deathbed. He tells his apprentice, "the protégé," that the inheritor will be... uh, this random unremarkable person, over there. Protégé is like "????? *sir what the fuck, after everything I've done for you*" but reluctantly concedes.
- The person, Holly, reaches her workplace and finds 1) all the lights are out and 2) the building's vacant. Enter the protégé, who formally tells her of---no, they did *not* kill her coworkers, everyone just got an email they had the day off; no, that doesn't include *you*, get back here---who formally does an exposition dump.
- Holly is totally down for this demonic deal, sure. No sarcasm. Seriously, about *time* something interesting happened around here. <strong style="text-transform:uppercase;font-weight:normal;">Lethal blood curse</strong> [or whatever it is] <strong style="text-transform:uppercase;font-weight:normal;">get!</strong>
- And now she can turn evil and shit, hell yeah. Society is very boned. But first, unfortunately, there's a shift to finish.

### vaguely-defined plot points
- "Protégé" sticks around as something of a second-in-command. Unsure whose idea this is.
- "You have all these grandiose powers and your evil alter ego is just like, a taller but otherwise regular-ass human??? *Coward. <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">Coward.</span>*" The "full demon" version still doesn't impress protégé much, smh. (If it was *their* turn they'd be like, full quadruped or something. But alas, they can't transform so dramatically. Cue talk of long-term goals and dreams and such, or something.)
- Protégé's not the only one who had an eye on the curse/powers/what-have-you. At one point they warn Holly/Lucien that there is *bureaucracy* to deal with, to help mitigate such troubles before they start. Lucien doesn't want to get involved and ignores all this.
- So naturally, someone tries to assassinate her. It (almost?) works! But Lucien gets back up anyway and, upon recognizing the would-be assailant as a childhood tormenter, essentially beats them to a pulp. Y'know, like playing with a ragdoll. Fun!
	- Protégé walks in on ↑this and suddenly realizes they have morals after all. Lucien doesn't seem guilty whatsoever. Great! Fantastic! Excellent! Thanks for your contribution!!!
- At some point after that (probably not too long? but not necessarily on the spot, either), protégé is like "a'ight I'm leaving your ass." They're very dramatic about it. Lucien's kinda just like "K" and that's that.

{%include figure.html src="" img="newhell" alt="“You /will/ get a redemption arc,” yells the protégé. “Or die. Mark my words!!!!”"%}<!--source to roundup-->

- Protégé meets up with the assassin's sibling---an identical twin, and the one who *actually* beat on Holly as a kid. Protégé claims they're convinced Holly/Lucien is redeemable, and they've just got to find out how; the twin, meanwhile, is less favorable. They team up anyway, united by the common banner of "what the fuck is even going on (and how do we stop it)."
- Also at some point Lucien just goes full demon and burns down the whole establishment. Not sure if this is a Climactic Event or like, the next big thing that happens after the assassination attempt.
