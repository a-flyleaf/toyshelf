(Not a title, although "New Hell" would be a funny location name...)

Pages spawned <b>August 1, 2022</b>. I have no idea if this is going to become a new Thing™ or if it's going to be one of those random story concepts I toy with for a little while and then forget about, but unlike previous wayward concepts I already have a bunch of drawings and ~disconnected scene ideas~, so... whoops?

Everything is <u>extremely likely to change</u>, as new ideas do. For sanity's sake I'll only be updating these pages **monthly**, at least until/unless things get more solidified. I kinda just want to experiment with having an idea public from really early on <span style="display:inline-block;">\o/

<p style="text-align:center;">+</p>

August 25th addendum: Idea has not taken over my life as initially feared, so I'm tentatively letting myself edit this "early" to jot down what I've come up with in the interim. We'll see how the pace of future edits goes, if I need to keep restraining myself or not....  
<b>September 19</b>: So for the record I didn't actually finish ↑ those edits, immediately thought of a good way to shorten the thing, and haven't been possessed again since so the new version hasn't been written down either <span style="display:inline-block;">:V</span> Maybe eventually...?

<section markdown="1">
## current premise
A sardonic worker inherits demonic powers, much to the chagrin of the protégé who was supposed to be next in line.

Way, *way* more lighthearted (and less abstracted/more straightforward) than [last round](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/ygbtdm/). (probably. Theoretically,,)  
Or maybe it’s a [dark comedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweeney_Todd:_The_Demon_Barber_of_Fleet_Street) <span style="display:inline-block;">¯\\\_(&nbsp;ツ&nbsp;)_/¯</span>

<b>December 24</b>: Sailing completely over prior developments, lately I have just been screwing around with the central duo's designs and idly entertaining the idea of like, What If It Was A Heartwarming Holiday Special about the Meaning of Friendship and Optimism and Everything Good (In Which the Protagonist Dies at the Beginning and *Must* Learn a Lesson to ?Live, But Also Who's to Judge Morals Like This Anyway). Idk, I've half-listened to An Amount of cheesy Christmas movies over the past few weeks.

Dunno what to do with these pages so I'm leaving them untouched from previous edits, for now....

<p style="text-align:center;">+</p>

<b>July 4, 2023</b>: ↑That did not stick either. Or at least not the parts about being a Heartwarming Holiday Special; "protagonist dies," perhaps.

<b>January 2, 2025</b>: literally what was I doing with any of this. i don't remember

<b>February 17</b>: This is now "oldhell" because I like to think I'm funny. Anything up-to-date will be on the [actual newhell index]({%include url.html%}/newhell), or wherever it may move.
