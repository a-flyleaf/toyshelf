Some people who exist, so far. Names are my burden!!!

## Holly [surname]/Lucien Grey
A sardonic server, AKA a much more expressive inheritor.

- Regular boring human, powers notwithstanding.
- Lives alone in a small apartment with several houseplants.
	- The oldest of these is [one of those stubborn species that Refuses to die], a moving-out gift from a relative. It doesn't match the rest and has been relegated to a corner, but Holly can't bring herself to get rid of it either.
- About average height (skewing shorter?) by default, ~7ft. as "Lucien," and Fucking Huge (as space will allow) as "full demon."

Yes, the "Lucien Grey" name is a riff on [a book I have not actually read](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray). I just think it's got a nice ring to it! (Surname might change.)

(The latest art includes sketches for the rest of the gang defined so far, but I can't be assed to make separate thumbnails yet)

## "the prot√©g√©"
The would-be inheritor.

- Also a regular boring human, or at least capable of looking like one. Might have ~changed~ a bit somewhere along the line.
- Taken under the wing of (if not outright adopted by) the previous power-holder; might have been orphaned?
	- But also probably has a big family, including at leat one younger sibling. (Family may not be 100% human.)
	- Really fucking loves the [found family](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyOfChoice) trope, too. None of these notes *have* to be mutually-exclusive.... ü§î
- Short ‚Äôn' round, at least in human form. At least one eye is almost always covered, for reasons I'm still figuring out.
- Formal, genuine, and a stickler for convention. Most likely to burst into ~~song~~ expositional monologue with zero prompting.

Currently using "they" in a "I don't know what their gender/pronouns are" way, but maybe that'll stick idk.

## the guy who Used to have the curse/powers
...and whose death sets off this whole shebang.

- Appears as a "full demon," unsure if that's just his species or what.
- Has a sad, tired face in the handful of drawings that exist so far. ~~Asgore lol~~
- It's unclear why he had a seemingly-random human inherit everything and not, y'know, the person he took in specifically *to* do that; answering that is something of a plot crux, but also idk the reason myself as a writer yet.
	- Thinking it has something to do with "these are Evil powers to be used For Evil, and your (the prot√©g√©'s) final test of worthiness is to disobey my order and take them for yourself." Needless to say It Did Not Work.
	- (But he probably foresaw the "chosen" recipient causing some degree of chaos anyway, if not in her own right then because of the ensuing power struggle as everyone else tries to seize it. Dude just went like üñï to everyone on the way out I guess...!)

He'll, uh, get developed more if/as I figure out more stuff about the setting, among other overarching stuff.

## everyone else
- Identical twin siblings, born human. At least one was Kind Of A Shithead‚Ñ¢ as a kid, less sure on the other. Possibly did a "role reversal" into adulthood, with the rowdy one just trying to settle down and live quietly whereas the other got roped up in ~supernatural stuff and tried to do an assassination. Or maybe that's what the survivor *wants* you to think...?
- Family (or lack thereof) seems to be a recurring Thing here, so at least one relative of prot√©g√©'s (and Holly's, much to her consternation) should probably be relevant too.
- There was a time I considered sticking Lucien in the same "universe"/continuity/whatever as either [the "sawface" human]({%include url.html%}/misc#sawface) or [the disaster crew]({%include url.html%}/disaster-crew). Have since decided against both, but maybe some [expies](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy) will show up <span style="display:inline-block;">¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø</span>
