(Not a title, although "New Hell" would be a funny location name...)

Pages spawned <b>August 1, 2022</b>. I have no idea if this is going to become a new Thing™ or if it's going to be one of those random story concepts I toy with for a little while and then forget about, but unlike previous wayward concepts I already have a bunch of drawings and ~disconnected scene ideas~, so... whoops?

Everything is <u>extremely likely to change</u>, as new ideas do. For sanity's sake I'll only be updating these pages **monthly**, at least until/unless things get more solidified. I kinda just want to experiment with having an idea public from really early on <span style="display:inline-block;">\o/

	<h2>current premise</h2>
	<p>A sardonic worker inherits demonic powers, much to the chagrin of the protégé who was supposed to be next in line. Shenanigans ensue.</p>
	
	<p>Way, <em>way</em> more lighthearted (and less abstracted/more straightforward) than <a href="https://a-flyleaf.github.io/ygbtdm/">last round</a>. (probably. Theoretically,,)</p>
