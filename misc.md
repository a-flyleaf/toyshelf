Assorted designs that I've remembered through the years. Most aren't Developed Characters with set personalities and backstories and all that jazz, they kinda just Exist and spark joy so here they are~

Ordered [chronologically]({%include url.html%}/timeline) by creation, more or less.

<h2 id="demon">doodle demon</h2>
A funky lil figure that pops up throughout my school notebooks. [I drew it once for an art class]({%include url.html%}/art/3demons) and was told "This is your Garfield." I don't want to market it or myself in any substantial way, but if I *had* to, I guess this feller would make a nifty mascot? I'm thinking less Garfield and more [Dolossus](https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/frd/3034277/4#post_48272006)....

## Nightpath
- Back in my [<i>Warriors</i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warriors_(novel_series)) phase (c. 2009!!), the official warrior name generator dubbed me "Nightpath." I used this name around a few sites, including [Wolf-Haven](https://wolf-haven.com/).
- A premium feature of Wolf-Haven allows users to customize their pixel avatars via drawing on a sprite sheet. I won a custom (through a means I've since forgotten; random giveaway? it wasn't a contest) and then realized I had no idea what I wanted my wolf to look like. By 2011, this design spawned!
- In 2020 I revisited the design, now with a little more hue contrast.
- That's it! I don't really do much with her.

<h2 id="slade">Slade Auctor</h2>
A young ’yote made for ['Souls RPG](https://soulsrpg.com/forum/) in 2010 (first reference posted 2011), and essentially a self-insert. Like Nightpath, he got RP'd sometimes but I don't feel the need to do much else with him. He gets used a lot more often for random art, though.

<div id="gallery">{%for art in site.art%}{%if art.tags contains "slade"%}<a href="{{art.url}}"><img src="{%include url.html%}/assets/img/art/{{art.date|date:"%F"}}-tn{%if art.multi%}-slade{%endif%}.jpg" alt="{{art.title}}"/></a>{%endif%}{%endfor%}</div>

## Zero
The first (and only) adoptable I got on deviantArt, 2012; originally an Isos by [Xeno-Ximen](https://www.deviantart.com/xeno-ximen). In 2018 I got permission to recycle him as an OC, which hasn't really changed much except that I don't credit his origins every time he shows up.

He has a few crumbs of personality and history, and it has nothing to do with the bio I wrote on his original reference: he's some kind of chimera-experiment (escaped, maybe?), spawned in a test tube, and is essentially a big playful puppy. Also, his design is all over the place, but as long as it's somewhere in the realm of recognizable, s'all good.

<h2 id="roommates">Flynn Smith & Ren Brandt</h2>
Scrapped characters from <i>The Firebird Effect</i> that got developed a whole lot more than their merged version. (They could probably have their own pages but, for lack of a better category, they're getting shoehorned here for now.) Both candidates for minor characters in the [disaster duo]({%include url.html%}/disaster-crew)'s storyline, Flynn primarily and Ren by extension.

Flynn's whole-ass story, plus a mini gallery, is in [this shriblet](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/shriblets/2019-05-wiki/); Ren has no equivalent.

- uhhh I don't feel like reposting all the wiki stuff unless they're gonna get their own pages
- although unless I wanna overhaul the tag system they *should* just have a disaster-crew page for ease of linking

## "sawface"
I have no idea what the hell spawned this thing, or the human that sometimes appears with it for that matter, but they sure do exist all right (and have since 2016). Any semblance of a character bio is also beyond me, but they Look Cool and That's What Matters™.

- on dA and ArtFight (both onsite and folder, there were some extras)
- also check tumblr? but ArtFight might cover that

"sawface" is in quotes because it's a moniker I slapped on for [ArtFight](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/artfight/for-me) in 2021, not sure I'd call it a Proper Name. Speaking of ArtFight, check out that link for some art by other people!

<h2 id="ehr">eel-horse-raptor</h2>
Had a school assignment in 2017 that involved combining three random animals; I choose a moray eel, a horse, and a velociraptor. This thing happened, and got drawn throughout the semester (and sometimes elsewhere). Wouldn't be surprised if it broke out of the same amalgamation factory as Zero.

Oh, and I guess it saves a kid?? Aforementioned semester topped off with a four-page comic and that happened. I stuck a design-sketch for that here too, even though it's not actually the eel-horse-raptor itself.

- see school folder
- also doodles from around that time
- has definitely been drawn sporadically on other dates (as have most of these really) but that's a LOT to sift through so. Nah Not Today
- OH AND THE SCULPT can I even still open that file

<h2 id="species">scrapped species</h2>
Around early 2018 a couple friends invited me to build a RP with custom worlds and species. This is the thing I made up. I don't remember anything else about it, nor have I drawn it much since, but I figured I'd shelve it here anyway.

- I think there are basically just like, Those Two Doodles, and maybe assorted headshots from around then

## "sika"
At one point in 2018 I read [Junji Ito's <i>Fragments of Horror</i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragments_of_Horror) and got the idea of a story set in Japan with that kind of ~vibe. Something like that?? Shit, dude, it's been years, I don't remember much. I think it centered on this person who died and then reappeared as a deer-cryptid, slowly transforming over the course of the story until running off for good at the end. Something something grief metaphor. It was almost definitely based directly off the plotline in one of the <i>Fragments</i> stories.

Anyway they're mostly here because the "typical straight-haired Asian + long face" vibe kinda reminded me of [a much more developed character from an actual Project™](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/ygbtdm/cast/kay-lin), which is a total coincidence but I thought that was funny. Also, I keep forgetting where the sketches are <span style="display:inline-block;">>:V</span>

- p much just sketchdump scribs, studies not included

<h2 id="cringetober">cringetober duo</h2>
A couple designs that spawned in 2020 as part of [the cringetober challenge](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/journal/hashtagCringetober2020-856778861). They got drawn a few times [for ArtFight](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/artfight/for-me) and I think that's pretty cool <span style="display:inline-block;">B)</span>

- for lack of a complete dA archive i GUESS you can repost everything

<h2 id="ena"><i>ENA</i>verse</h2>
Fan characters based on [Joel Guerra's <i>ENA</i> webseries](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhPaJURyApsoMQDaoft5t0l0iAwUOLtlM), which I was very intensely into for a few months in early 2021.

- The duck-rabbit was going to be used for some animation tests, most of which weren't quite executed.
- Fans of the series have taken to making their own polygon people, "enasonas," and I wanted in. It is totally not a self-insert with the crux of a recurring issue in my life, you guys.

Other than sharing a "canon" they're not related, but they're not individually-defined enough to warrant separate subheaders either.

## hellrabbit
Awful, awful creature made as part of [<i>You're gonna be the death of me</i>](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/ygbtdm/), but I draw it on its own sometimes so *what the heck* here it is.

- scour sketches from the roundups

Besides the above, all scoured from [monthly roundups](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/ygbtdm/gallery/roundups), there's a few standalones in [the project's general gallery](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/ygbtdm/gallery).

<h2 id="wolf">“wolf-skull”</h2>
Minor/side character in [<i>You're gonna be the death of me</i>](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/ygbtdm/) whose design I like too much because *of course I do, I gave them a wolf motif, I dug my own grave I'll lie in it.* Basically recycles Flynn's body type, yes---but besides both being showy ?brunettes, they're not terribly similar.

- also scoured from roundups
- plus that one standalone comic-thign??
