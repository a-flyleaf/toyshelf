Assorted designs that have stuck through the years. Most aren't Developed Characters with set personalities and backstories and all that jazz, they kinda just Exist and spark joy so here they are~

## doodle demon
A funky lil figure that pops up throughout my school notebooks. I drew it once for an art class (not shown here) and was told "This is your Garfield." I don't want to market it or myself in any substantial way, but if I *had* to, I guess this feller would make a nifty mascot?

- doodle demon @ dA
- ok maaaybe cropped versions of the art class triad
- that one pixel art from the old blog?

## Nightpath
- Back in my [<i>Warriors</i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warriors_(novel_series)) phase (c. 2009!!), the official warrior name generator dubbed me "Nightpath." I used this name around a few sites, including [Wolf-Haven](https://wolf-haven.com/).
- A premium feature of Wolf-Haven allows users to customize their pixel avatars via drawing on a sprite sheet. I won a custom (through a means I've since forgotten; random giveaway? it wasn't a contest) and then realized I had no idea what I wanted my wolf to look like. By 2011, this design spawned!
- In [201?] I revisited the design, now with a little more hue contrast.
- That's it! I don't really do much with her.

- original design: [MSPaint](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/Nightpath-Reference-245327636) & [GIMP](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/Nightpath-Reference-v2-259953584)
- updated reference (in a roundup somewhere, 2021?)
- Wolvden adopt

## Slade Auctor
A young ’yote made for ['Souls RPG](https://soulsrpg.com/forum/) in 2011, and essentially a self-insert. Like Nightpath, he got RP'd sometimes but I don't feel the need to do much else with him. He gets used a lot more often for random art, though.

- anything I can find on archive.org or elsewhere in ancient files maybe
- he has his own dA tag too

## Zero
The first (and so far only) adoptable I got on deviantArt, originally an Isos by [Xeno-Ximen](https://www.deviantart.com/xeno-ximen). In 2018 I got permission to recycle him as an OC, which hasn't really changed much except that I don't credit his origins every time he shows up.

He has a few crumbs of personality and history, and it has nothing to do with the bio I wrote on his original reference: he's some kind of chimera-experiment (escaped, maybe?), spawned in a test tube, and is essentially a big playful puppy. Also, his design is all over the place, but as long as it's somewhere in the realm of recognizable, s'all good.

- has a dA tag
- also check what I threw on ArtFight because some of that is definitely not on dA

## "sawface"
I have no idea what the hell spawned this thing, or the human that sometimes appears with it for that matter, but they sure do exist all right (and have since 2016). Any semblance of a character bio is also beyond me, but they Look Cool and That's What Matters™.

- on dA and ArtFight (both onsite and folder, there were some extras)
- also check tumblr? but ArtFight might cover that

## eel-horse-raptor
Had a school assignment in 2017 that involved combining three random animals; I choose a moray eel, a horse, and a velociraptor. This thing happened, and got drawn throughout the semester (and sometimes elsewhere). Wouldn't be surprised if it broke out of the same amalgamation factory as Zero.

Oh, and I guess it saves a kid?? Aforementioned semester topped off with a four-page comic and that happened. I stuck a design-sketch for that here too, even though it's not actually the eel-horse-raptor itself.

- see school folder
- also doodles from around that time
- has definitely been drawn sporadically on other dates (as have most of these really) but that's a LOT to sift through so. Nah Not Today

## scrapped species
In 2018 a couple friends invited me to build a RP with custom worlds and species. This is the thing I made up. I don't remember anything else about it, nor have I drawn it much since, but I figured I'd shelve it here anyway.

- I think there are basically just like, Those Two Doodles, and maybe assorted headshots from around then

## hellrabbit
Awful, awful creature made as part of [<i>You're gonna be the death of me</i>](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/ygbtdm/), but I draw it on its own sometimes so *what the heck* here it is.

## other not-critters
(could be its own category/page)
- <b>Flynn and Ren</b>: "rewritten roommates" or Those Two Guys (though only one is A Guy); scrapped characters from <i>The Firebird Effect</i> that got developed a whole lot more than their merged version. Both candidates for minor characters in the [disaster duo]({%include url.html%}/disaster-crew)'s storyline, Flynn primarily and Ren by extension.
- "<b>wolf-skull</b>": Minor/side character in [<i>You're gonna be the death of me</i>](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/ygbtdm/) whose design I like too much because *of course I do, I gave them a wolf motif, I dug my own grave I'll lie in it.*
- <b>ENAverse</b>: Fan characters based on [Joel Guerra's <i>ENA</i> webseries]: a duck-rabbit fremd (animation ideas included but never quite executed), and an "enasona" (because fans of the series have taken to making their own polygon people and I wanted in). The latter is like, totally not a self-insert with the crux of a recurring issue in my own life, you guys.
- "<b>sika</b>": At one point in [year?] I read [Junji Ito's <i>Fragments of Horror</i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragments_of_Horror) and got the idea of a story set in Japan with that kind of ~vibe. Something like that?? Shit, dude, it's been years, I don't remember much. I think it centered on this person who died and then reappeared as a deer-cryptid, slowly transforming over the course of the story until running off for good at the end. Something something grief metaphor. It was almost definitely based directly off the plotline in one of the <i>Fragments</i> stories.  
	Anyway they're mostly here because the "typical straight-haired Asian + long face" vibe kinda reminded me of [a much more developed character from an actual Project™](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/ygbtdm/cast/kay-lin), which is a total coincidence but I thought that was funny.
