## Why "Toyshelf"?
A riff on the Toyhouse name, and more relevant to me personally. All these characters are effectively "shelved"; they're kinda just Sitting There, Existing, not taking part in any ongoing or previously-certain story.

## Why not use Toyhouse?
The cool and friendly reason is that I like how GitHub keeps track of dates and changes automatically, and coding everything from scratch offers me maximum control.

The snooty reason is that I have an elitist ideological aversion, in the same petty realm as the desire to avoid writing "Mary Sues," to treating characters like "toys." Which, to be crystal clear, isn't a judgment of the site itself or its users; Toyhouse looks like a wonderfully convenient thing, and I would probably have used it myself if I'd discovered it a few years' sooner.

That said, I often tell myself I don't see the ~point~ in having characters devoid of story. Which means that I don't (didn't) feel the need to have character profiles that spell out everything like a wiki, since I feel like characterization is conveyed most strongly through, y'know, story.

And yet! I am not immune to "characters" without established canons. Some of them are designs that have stuck around through the years, without any particular rhyme or reason; others are interconnected *somehow*, possibly, but since I haven't gotten around to coalescing any sort of Story Canon besides the context of those connections, they occupy a similar canonical limbo.

TL;DR am full of self

## \[something about characters being for "sale" or design "theft" or anything of that sort]
Yeahhhhhh nah I don't approach characters this way. I believe you can't copyright a design or concept, and have zero interest in chasing people down for "stealing" my ideas. Hell, if you're inspired by something I do, I'd probably love to see it! Most of *my* stuff started as "basically a ripoff of \[existing media property]." Besides, when it comes to creativity, no two people are going to interpret the same thing the same way; just look at the swath of Inktober prompts from the same word, or even interpretations of a character by different writers in a frnachise.

Mini creative manifesto aside, TL;DR: I don't treat characters (or their designs) as commodities. While it would probably bug me to see a blatant uncredited copy, I'm not gonna lose sleep over it, and wholeheartedly encourage people to do whatever they want with any ideas, visual and/or in writing, that they want to play with.

## Can I \[do something] with *your* characters, specifically?
*Go for it, man.* If you're making money off it that's going to make me sad, though. A royalty would be nice. <span style="inline-block;">:(</span>

(Should go without saying, but I would **very strongly appreciate** credit in some way, since you are using *my thing specifically*. I would appreciate credit for looser ~inspiration~ too, as covered above, but recognize that's a lot more tenuous. And please don't suggest I endorse whatever you're doing unless I actually, like, *do*.)

(P.S. I probably want to see the thing you make!!)

## Do these *laissez-faire* ideas about originality and creative "permissions" apply to *all* your work?

*Hell yeah, dude.*

## Why do you sound so formal?

Listne. There is [a version of this writeup](LINK GOES HERE) where I don't capitalize the beginning of sentences and use emojis and everything. Something about the Vibe changes when it becomes a more formalized mini-site, though, y'feel?

## Who even are you?
I don't know how you found <span style="font-family:monospace;">a hyphen flyleaf dot github dot io slash *a-flyleaf's toyshelf*</span> without knowing who a-flyleaf is (and if you did I am very curious, I don't use analytics, [consider saying hello](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/about#obligatory-contact-section)), but!:

Hi, I'm a-flyleaf, and I've been drawing and storytelling since I was a little kid. I used to write & illustrate stories about my family as anthropomorphic animals going on whimsical fantasy adventures, and now I bury myself in bullet points about regular-ass *Homo sapiens* and their dysfunctional relationships. Unrelated to that, the artstuff has also spawned some weird critters over the years, which I went ahead and made homes for here too. I end my sentences with periods a lot less frequently than this page may imply.

Thanks for stopping by <span style="display:inline-block;">\o/</span>
