## Why "Toyshelf"?
A riff on the [Toyhouse](https://toyhou.se/) name, and more relevant to me personally. The original thought was that all these characters are effectively "shelved"; they're mostly kinda just Sitting There, Existing, not taking part in any ongoing or previously-certain story.

I say "original thought" because this hasn't been 100% true [from the]({%include url.html%}/misc#hellrabbit) [getgo]({%include url.html%}/misc#ws). In August&nbsp;2022 I also dumped a bunch of [extremely premature concepts]({%include url.html%}/newhell) here, for no particular reason except that I felt like it at the time.

Some shelves are dustier than others, let's put it that way <span style="display:inline-block;">:V</span>

## Why not use Toyhouse?
### The Cool and Friendly Reason
- Coding everything from scratch offers me <em style="text-transform:uppercase;font-style:normal;">all</em> the customization. At the time of writing every page follows the same template, but hypothetically, I *could* deck every single one out individually with CSS if I wanted to; no premium membership necessary!
- Relatedly, I am a strong proponent of [owning one's platform](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/blog/own-your-platform). Is Toyhouse a social media website? Not really, I don't think. But would I rather go "my city now" anyway? *Heck yeah.*

### the snooty elitist reason
- I have an irrational internalized-cringe-borne aversion to treating characters like "toys"; if they don't have a story, I'd hesitate to call them full-fledged Characters™.
	- <small>Obligate disclaimer that this is a Me&nbsp;Thing, not a value judgment on Toyhouse or its users! Hell, if I'd discovered Toyhouse earlier into my internet adventures, I might be an avid user today.</small>
- When I *do* have Characters™, I want their traits to come across through, y'know, *the story,* and not by spelling everything out in wiki-esque character profiles.
- *And yet!* I am not immune to "characters" without established canons. [Some of them]({%include url.html%}/misc) are designs that have stuck around for some significant degree of time (as in I didn't just draw them once and then forget); [others]({%include url.html%}/disaster-crew) are interconnected *somehow*, possibly, but since I haven't gotten around to coalescing any sort of Story Canon besides the context of those connections, they occupy a similar canonical limbo.
- Figured a Toyhouse-esque site would be a good compromise between having an info hub and committing to an Official Repository™, so here we are!

TL;DR am full of self

## \[something about characters being "for sale" or "design theft" or anything of that sort]
Yeahhhhhh nah I don't approach characters this way. I believe that you can't truly "own" a design or concept, and thus have zero interest in chasing people down for "stealing" my ideas. Hell, if you're inspired by something I do, I'd probably love to see it!

Characters are not copyrighted commodities, to me. While it would bug me to see a blatant uncredited recolor, I'm not gonna lose sleep over it. I wholeheartedly encourage people to do whatever they want with any ideas, visual and/or in writing, that they want to play with.

## Can I \[do something with] *your* characters, specifically?
*Go for it, man.* If you're making money off it that's going to make me sad, though. A royalty would be nice. <span style="inline-block;">:(</span>

(Should go without saying, but I would **very strongly appreciate** credit in some way, since you are using *my characters specifically*. (I would appreciate credit for looser ~inspiration~ too, as covered above, but I recognize that's more of a gray area.) And please don't suggest I endorse whatever you're doing unless I actually, like, *do*.)

(P.S. Have I mentioned I probably want to see the thing you make? I want to see the thing you make!!)

## Do these <dfn title="freeform, essentially">laissez-faire</dfn> ideas about originality and creative "permissions" apply to *all* your work?

*Hell yeah, dude.*

## Who even are you?
I don't know how you found <i>a-flyleaf's toyshelf</i> at <span class="code">a hyphen flyleaf dot github dot io</span> without knowing who a-flyleaf is (and if you did I am very curious, I don't use analytics, [consider saying hello](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/about#contact)), but!:

Hi, I'm a-flyleaf, and I've been drawing and storytelling since I was a little kid. I used to write & illustrate stories about my family as anthropomorphic animals going on whimsical fantasy adventures, and now I bury myself in bullet points about regular-ass *Homo sapiens* and their dysfunctional relationships. Unrelated to that, the artstuff has also spawned some weird critters over the years, which I went ahead and made homes for here too. I end my sentences with periods a lot less frequently than this paragraph may imply.

Thanks for stopping by <span style="display:inline-block;">\o/</span>


## about site
Made over the course of a month, [on and off]({%include url.html%}/changelog), with the same tools as everything else in the a-flyleaf.github ecosystem: [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) + good ol' HTML + CSS.

Techy explanation for the "backend site generation" date-fudging that comes up with certain art:
- Art pages and  their thumbnails are generated automatically.
- To grab the image URL, the layout pulls from the page date in <abbr title="year-month-day">YYYY-MM-DD</abbr> format.
- Because it *only* looks for date information, different art posts can't share a date.

There is probably a workaround, or a better way to do it from the ground up. I'll figure that out if I need to, but for now this doesn't come up often enough to warrant it.
