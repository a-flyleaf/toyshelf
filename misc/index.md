Assorted designs that I've remembered through the years. Most aren't Developed Characters with set personalities and backstories and all that jazz, they kinda just Exist and spark joy so here they are~

Ordered chronologically by creation, more or less. Those with lots of art (>9) have been punted to individual pages.

<h2 id="demon">doodle demon</h2>
A funky lil figure that pops up throughout my school notebooks. [I drew it once for an art class]({%include url.html%}/art/3demons) and was told "This is your Garfield." I don't want to market it or myself in any substantial way, but if I *had* to, I guess this feller would make a nifty mascot? I'm thinking less Garfield and more [Dolossus](https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/frd/3034277/4#post_48272006)....

## Nightpath
- Back in my [<i>Warriors</i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warriors_(novel_series)) phase (c. 2009!!), the official warrior name generator dubbed me "Nightpath." I used this name around a few sites, including [Wolf-Haven](https://wolf-haven.com/).
- A premium feature of Wolf-Haven allows users to customize their pixel avatars via drawing on a sprite sheet. I won a custom (through a means I've since forgotten; random giveaway? it wasn't a contest) and then realized I had no idea what I wanted my wolf to look like. By 2011, this design spawned!
- In 2020 I revisited the design, now with a little more hue contrast.
- That's it! I don't really do much with her.

<div id="gallery">{%for art in site.art%}{%if art.tags contains "nightpath"%}<a href="{%include url.html%}{{art.url}}"><img src="{%include url.html%}/assets/img/art/{{art.date|date:"%F"}}-tn{%if art.multi%}-nightpath{%endif%}.jpg" alt="{{art.title}}"/></a>{%endif%}{%endfor%}</div>

<h2 id="slade">Slade Auctor</h2>
A young ’yote made for ['Souls RPG](https://soulsrpg.com/forum/) in 2010 (first reference posted 2011), and essentially a self-insert. Like Nightpath, he got RP'd sometimes but I don't feel the need to do much else with him. He gets used a lot more often for random art, though.

<div id="gallery">{%for art in site.art%}{%if art.tags contains "slade"%}<a href="{%include url.html%}{{art.url}}"><img src="{%include url.html%}/assets/img/art/{{art.date|date:"%F"}}-tn{%if art.multi%}-slade{%endif%}.jpg" alt="{{art.title}}"/></a>{%endif%}{%endfor%}</div>

## Zero
<figure><a href="{%include url.html%}/misc/zero"><img src="{%include url.html%}/assets/img/zero-tmp.png" alt=""/></a></figure>
<p class="movin"><a href="{%include url.html%}/misc/zero" class="box moved">Has his own page!</a></p>

<h2 id="roommates">Flynn Smith & Ren Brandt</h2>
<figure><a href="https://angelicguy.tumblr.com/post/174622796714/wakes-up-oh-fuck-i-need-to-protect-women-runs"><img src="{%include url.html%}/assets/img/roommates.png" alt=""/></a></figure>

Scrapped characters from <i>The Firebird Effect</i> that got developed a whole lot more than their merged version. (They could probably have their own pages but, for lack of a better category, they're getting shoehorned here for now.) Both candidates for minor characters in the [disaster duo]({%include url.html%}/disaster-crew)'s storyline, Flynn primarily and Ren by extension.

Flynn's whole-ass story, plus a mini gallery, is in [this shriblet](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/shriblets/2019-05-wiki/); Ren has no equivalent.

- uhhh I don't feel like reposting all the wiki stuff unless they're gonna get their own pages
- although unless I wanna overhaul the tag system they *should* just have a disaster-crew page for ease of linking

Notes to self aside, [here's the Flynn art]({%include url.html%}/art/flynnard) that made it here.

## "sawface"
I have no idea what the hell spawned this thing, or the human that sometimes appears with it for that matter, but they sure do exist all right (and have since 2016). Any semblance of a character bio is also beyond me, but they Look Cool and That's What Matters™.

<div id="gallery">{%for art in site.art%}{%if art.tags contains "sawface"%}<a href="{%include url.html%}{{art.url}}"><img src="{%include url.html%}/assets/img/art/{{art.date|date:"%F"}}-tn{%if art.multi%}-sawface{%endif%}.jpg" alt="{{art.title}}"/></a>{%endif%}{%endfor%}</div>

"sawface" is in quotes because it's a moniker I slapped on for [ArtFight](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/artfight/for-me) in 2021, not sure I'd call it a Proper Name. Speaking of ArtFight, check out that link for some art by other people!

<h2 id="ehr">eel-horse-raptor</h2>
<figure><a href="{%include url.html%}/misc/eel-horse-raptor"><img src="{%include url.html%}/assets/img/ehr-tmp.png" alt=""/></a></figure>
<p class="movin"><a href="{%include url.html%}/misc/eel-horse-raptor" class="box moved">Has its own page!</a></p>

<h2 id="species">scrapped species</h2>
Around early 2018 a couple friends invited me to build a RP with custom worlds and species. This is the thing I made up. I don't remember anything else about it, nor have I drawn it much since, but I figured I'd shelve it here anyway.

<div id="gallery">{%for art in site.art%}{%if art.tags contains "species"%}<a href="{%include url.html%}{{art.url}}"><img src="{%include url.html%}/assets/img/art/{{art.date|date:"%F"}}-tn{%if art.multi%}-species{%endif%}.jpg" alt="{{art.title}}"/></a>{%endif%}{%endfor%}</div>

<h2 id="cringetober">cringetober duo</h2>
<figure><a href="https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/art/cringetober-except-it-s-november-860644053"><img src="{%include url.html%}/assets/img/cringetober.png" alt=""/></a></figure>

A couple designs that spawned in 2020 as part of [the cringetober challenge](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/journal/hashtagCringetober2020-856778861). They got drawn a few times [for ArtFight](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/artfight/for-me) and I think that's pretty cool <span style="display:inline-block;">B)</span>

- All their art by yours truly is [on dA](https://www.deviantart.com/a-flyleaf/gallery?q=%23cringetober) and I do not feel like reuploading it <span style="display:inline-block;">\o/</span>

<h2 id="ena"><i>ENA</i>verse</h2>
Fan characters based on [Joel Guerra's <i>ENA</i> webseries](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhPaJURyApsoMQDaoft5t0l0iAwUOLtlM), which I was very intensely into for a few months in early 2021.

- The duck-rabbit was going to be used for some animation tests, most of which weren't quite executed.
- Fans of the series have taken to making their own polygon people, "enasonas," and I wanted in. It is totally not a self-insert based on a recurring issue in my life, you guys.

Other than sharing a "canon" they're not related, but they're not individually-defined enough to warrant separate subheaders either.

<div id="gallery">{%for art in site.art%}{%if art.tags contains "ena"%}<a href="{%include url.html%}{{art.url}}"><img src="{%include url.html%}/assets/img/art/{{art.date|date:"%F"}}-tn{%if art.multi%}-ena{%endif%}.jpg" alt="{{art.title}}"/></a>{%endif%}{%endfor%}</div>

<p style="line-height:125%; color:#808080; margin-top:-1em;"><small>These thumbnails kind of look like ass because technicolor pixel art doesn't like JPEG compression. Fullsize images are high quality.</small></p>

## hellrabbit
Awful, awful creature made as part of [<i>You're gonna be the death of me</i>](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/ygbtdm/), but I draw it on its own sometimes so *what the heck* here it is.

Also, it has [a theme song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMOd6jz548Y).

<div id="gallery">{%for art in site.art%}{%if art.tags contains "hellrabbit"%}<a href="{%include url.html%}{{art.url}}"><img src="{%include url.html%}/assets/img/art/{{art.date|date:"%F"}}-tn{%if art.multi%}-hellrabbit{%endif%}.jpg" alt="{{art.title}}"/></a>{%endif%}{%endfor%}</div>

Besides the above, mostly snipped from [monthly roundups](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/ygbtdm/gallery/roundups), there's a few standalones in [the project's general gallery](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/ygbtdm/gallery).

<h2 id="wolf">“wolf-skull”</h2>
Minor/side character in [<i>You're gonna be the death of me</i>](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/ygbtdm/) whose design I like too much because *of course I do, I gave them a wolf motif, I dug my own grave I'll lie in it.* Basically recycles Flynn's body type, yes---but besides both being showy ?brunettes, they're not terribly similar.
