  Had a school assignment in 2017 that involved combining three random animals; I chose a moray eel, a horse, and a velociraptor. This thing happened, and got drawn throughout the semester (and sometimes elsewhere). Wouldn't be surprised if it broke out of the same amalgamation factory as [Zero](zero).
  
  Oh, and I guess it saves a kid?? Aforementioned semester topped off with a four-page comic, in which the kid-saving happened. I had no memory of any of that lore until revisiting the files for the sake of this site, so uh, weigh that with however much salt seems appropriate.

trivia: |-
  - Reasoning for the chimera'd choices: I was very much a dinosaur kid and velociraptors have [badass claws](https://www.livescience.com/17485-velociraptors-killer-claws.html) + I'd taken a marine biology class over a previous semester and the animal I chose to spotlight in my final was the moray eel (<span style="display:inline-block;"><3</span>, [luv them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharyngeal_jaw)) + hor?ses???? for some reason????????
  - No seriously why did I choose horses. Their anatomy is suffering; did I *want* to suffer(/challenge myself)?? I might have a reason in my class notebook but to memory it is a mystery.
  - I mean, the animals had to be very different; an eel-fish-snake wouldn't have been allowed. But *horses???*
