  The first (and only) adoptable I got on deviantArt, 2012; originally an Isos by [Xeno-Ximen](https://www.deviantart.com/xeno-ximen). In 2018 I got permission to recycle him as an OC, which hasn't really changed much except that I don't credit his origins every time he shows up.
  
  He has a few crumbs of personality and history, none of which have anything to do with the bio I wrote on his original reference: Zero is some kind of chimera-experiment (escaped, maybe?), spawned in a test tube, and is essentially a big playful puppy. Also, his design is all over the place, but as long as it's somewhere in the realm of recognizable, s'all good.

trivia: |-
  - I use he/him out of habit but anything goes, really. Weird lizards need not for obligate genders or pronouns <span style="display inline-block;">\o/</span>
  - Come to think of it, I'm not even sure if Zero's a "lizard." Or a mammal. Or a dragon. Or... anything in particular anymore, really? Zero is Zero.
