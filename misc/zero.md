  The first (and only) adoptable I got on deviantArt, 2012; originally an Isos by [Xeno-Ximen](https://www.deviantart.com/xeno-ximen). In 2018 I got permission to recycle him as an OC, which hasn't really changed much except that I don't credit his origins every time he shows up.
  
  He has a few crumbs of personality and history, none of which have anything to do with the bio I wrote on his original reference: Zero is some kind of chimera-experiment (escaped, maybe?), spawned in a test tube, and is essentially a big playful puppy. Also, his design is all over the place, but as long as it's somewhere in the realm of recognizable, s'all good.

trivia: |-
  - I use he/him out of habit but anything goes, really. Weird lizards need not for obligate genders or pronouns <span style="display inline-block;">\o/</span>
  - Come to think of it, I'm not even sure if Zero's a "lizard." Or a mammal. Or a dragon. Or... anything in particular anymore, really? Zero is Zero.
  
  ### [ArtFight](https://artfight.net/character/1439410.zero) description
  > A technicolor lizardy-friemd that I’ve had since 2012, and his design has never ever *ever* been perfectly consistent but I have fun with it—and so have other people, with things like [making his dot markings look like <b>extra eyes</b>](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/350353682489147393/521831635738558467/IMG_20181210_233027.jpg) (by the lovely [starmoths](https://www.deviantart.com/starmoths)!) and [adding <b>glowy effects</b>](https://www.deviantart.com/serosthedragon/art/Gift-for-A-FlyLeaf-878643581). And now I invite y’all to do the same >;3

  > Doesn’t have much lore but I roleplayed him briefly, and here’s the gist:
  > - created in some sort of laboratory for unknown reasons; wholly organic, with no supernatural powers
  > - naturally curious, playful, and trusting; skittish in threatening situations
  > - basically just wanders around exploring the world, sticking his snout where it doesn’t belong
  > - would probably love to meet you(r character/s)!
  > - no seriously he’s like horse-sized or bigger he will give rides to the little ones
