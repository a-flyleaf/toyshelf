summary: Half of the "disaster duo." Formerly an adventurous go-getter, currently a depressed shut-in.

info: |-
  - 2012: gregarious, showy with a troublemaking streak, had anger issues.<br/>2017: pretty much #done with life, occasional jokester, still has anger issues.
  - It all started when his parents divorced...
  - He and [Tara]({%include url.html%}/disaster-crew/tara) used to prank call scam lines and talk local delivery services into "updog"s. Nowadays he kills time by trying to get the kids in <i>Call of Duty</i> to stop screaming profanities—when, y'know, he's not yelling back.
  - Once wanted to be a lifeguard. The first time he tried to save someone, they both nearly drowned.
  - Plays a mean "Wonderwall." Enjoys karaoke night at the local bar, when he can get away with it.

design: |-
  - <b>main shape</b>: House-shaped pentagon, but upside-down and with the tip cut off.
  - <b>color association(s)</b>: Bright green as a kid, faded red as an adult.
    - Has red-green colorblindness.
  - In 2012, usually had an obvious tan. Slim, athletic.
  - By 2017, showers once every few weeks. Skin and bones.

trivia: |-
  - Originally named "Nathaniel '[Nate](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Nate)' Pine(s)"; don't think I ever figured out whether the surname had an <i>S</i> at the end or not. The name still sounds fitting enough, but it got changed when he stopped being a pokémon person. New name derived from [<i>Nicotiana sylvestris</i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotiana_sylvestris).
