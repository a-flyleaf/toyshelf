- 2012: gregarious, showy with a troublemaking streak, had anger issues.<br/>2017: pretty much #done with lie, occasional jokester, still has anger issues.
- It all started when his parents divorced...
- He and [Tara]({%include url.html%}/disaster-crew/tara) used to prank call the scam lines and talk local delivery services into "updog"s. Nowadays he kills time by trying to get the kids in *Call of Duty* to stop screaming profanities—when he's not joining them, at least.
- Once wanted to be a lifeguard; almost drowned on his first attempted rescue. Plays a mean "Wonderwall," and enjoys karaoke night at the local bar.

### design notes
- <b>main shape</b>: House-shaped pentagon, but upside-down and with the tip cut off.
- <b>color association(s)</b>: Is red-green colorblind but used to wear those colors a lot.
- In 2012, usually had an obvious tan.
- By 2017, showers once every few weeks.

	<h2>author notes</h2>
	<ul><li>Originally named "Nathaniel '[Nate]' Pine(s)"; don't think I ever figured out whether the surname had an 's' at the end or not. The name still "fits" (entirely for sound, paying zero attention to meaning), but it got changed when Nico stopped being a pokémon person.</li></ul>
