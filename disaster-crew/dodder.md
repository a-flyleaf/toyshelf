summary: Charming head of independent investigations, whether as an interrogator in a missing person case or (five years later) a self-help guru with a near-death testimony.

info: |-
  - Thinks he could sell ethics to the president. Romanticizes romanticism, and prides himself on his determination to make the most miserable people smile.
  - High school football sweetheart, still riding that high. Has changed lives in the span of a night; his own was transformed after a memorable evening in 2013, which directly preceded a multi-year coma.
  - In college, made a documentary about a local gated community that he considered a cult. Long-term story relation to the other characters is shaky at best, but he definitely had a heavy influence on at least one of them.
  - Nickname "Dodder" was originally derogatory, given his "clingy" nature and stringy yellow hair. Has since embraced it.

design: |-
  - <b>main shape</b>: Abrupt curves and zigzags.
  - <b>color association(s)</b>: Gold-yellow-orange-ish, saturated (2012) and/or faded (2017).
  - Lost significant weight between 2012 and 2017.
  - 2017's haggard appearance is very intentional in-universe, and somewhat manufactured.

songs: Doesn't have any, to memory? Maybe ["For the Love of Life" (David Sylvan)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhPGbr51jfc), or something with similar vibes...
voice: Also <abbr title="not available">n/a</abbr>.

trivia: >-
  - Surname snipped from [haustorium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haustorium), part of [the dodder plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuscuta). "Conor" just sounded nice and had [a relevant meaning](https://www.behindthename.com/name/conor): it's derived from names meaning "hound, dog, wolf" and "desiring."
