- 6\'00\"/XXXcm

## summary
Charming head of independent investigations, whether as an interrogator in a missing person case or (five years later) a self-help guru with a near-death testimony.

## info
- Thinks he could sell ethics to the president. Romanticizes romanticism, and prides himself on his ability to make the most miserable people smile.
- High school football sweetheart, still riding that high. Has changed lives in the span of a night; his own was transformed after a memorable one in 2013, after which he fell into a multi-year coma.
- Once made a college documentary about a local gated community that he considered a cult. Long-term story relation to the other characters is shaky at best, but he definitely had a heavy influence on at least one of them.
- Nickname "Dodder" was originally derogatory, given his "clingy" nature and stringy yellow hair. Has since embraced it.

## design notes
- <b>main shape</b>: Abrupt curves and zigzags.
- <b>color association(s)</b>: Gold-yellow-orange-ish, saturated (2012) and/or faded (2017).
- Lost significant weight between 2012 and 2017.
- 2017's haggard appearance is very intentional, and somewhat manufactured.
