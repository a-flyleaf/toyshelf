info: |-
  - Thinks he could sell ethics to the president. Romanticizes romanticism, and prides himself on his ability to make the most miserable people smile.
  - High school football sweetheart, still riding that high. Has changed lives in the span of a night; his own was transformed after a memorable one in 2013, after which he fell into a multi-year coma.
  - Once made a college documentary about a local gated community that he considered a cult. Long-term story relation to the other characters is shaky at best, but he definitely had a heavy influence on at least one of them.
  - Nickname "Dodder" was originally derogatory, given his "clingy" nature and stringy yellow hair. Has since embraced it.
