summary: Charming head of independent investigations, whether as an interrogator in a missing person case or (five years later) a self-help guru with a near-death testimony.

info: |-
  - Thinks he could sell ethics to the president. Romanticizes romanticism, and prides himself on his determination to make the most miserable people smile.
  - High school football sweetheart, still riding that high. Has changed lives in the span of a night; his own was transformed after a memorable evening in 2013, which directly preceded a multi-year coma.
  - In college, made a documentary about a local gated community that he considered a cult. Long-term story relation to the other characters is shaky at best, but he definitely had a heavy influence on at least one of them.
  - Nickname "Dodder" was originally derogatory, given his "clingy" nature and stringy yellow hair. Has since embraced it.

design: |-

  - Lost significant weight between 2012 and 2017.
  - 2017's haggard appearance is very intentional, and somewhat manufactured.
