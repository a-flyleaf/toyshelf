summary: Random little girl in a creepy-ass mansion in the middle of the woods, what could possibly go wrong? Story status uncertain, but could be a ghost in 2017.

info: |-
  - Tends to come off as a charming little girl scout with a knife behind her back, an impression she exploits for fun---except instead of a knife, she loves taxidermy, and it's not behind her back at all because she's happy to elaborate. Big motormouth tendencies.
  - One grandfather taught her how to skin a squirrel and the other read classic novels as bedtime stories. They made some *mistakes* with their youngest son, but far as Ava's concerned, they get an A+ for her own parenting.
  - Probably died in 2012—although there are other versions of the story where she's still around 5 years later. In this case she's made a little name for herself in the local gay bar, in which she drinks absolutely nothing, listens to almost anyone for however long they talk, and advises people on becoming their best selves. Adult!Ava is also possibly friends with [Flynn](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/shriblets/2019-05-wiki/) and later [Nico](nico).
  - Has no WiFi at home and acts technologically illiterate when convenient.
  - Plays a mean, vulgar game of Cards Against Humanity, and can do it with a straight face if she wants to.

design: |-
  - <b>main shape</b>: Rounded hourglass, with occasional points.
  - <b>color association(s)</b>: Yellow, overall. Outfits skew towards natural colors, notably brown (kid) and green (adult).
  - Extremely unlikely to dress in modern/trendy clothes, no matter what year.
    - Her adult default looks kinda contemporary anyway because the artist does not understand fashion.
  - Has a prosthetic foot, which may look jarringly mechanical in her usual environments; this dissonance is intentional.
    - The side this is on has never been consistent, no. Not intentional. I wanna say it *should* be her left (viewer's right), though.
    - Not always the same prosthetic! In 2012 it's more dynamic (I usually reference [this one](https://www.blatchfordus.com/products/mini-bladext/)); in later years the foot looks more like the one shoes are made for.

songs: |-
  - ["Swing You Sinners" – Fleischer Studios](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNttqN1wUMY)
  - ["Pavlov's Daughter" – Regina Spektor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dViqe8E6kGA)

voice: |-
  - general?: Jillian Ashcraft as Monika (<i>Doki Doki Literature Club!</i>)
  - Could've sworn there was a different 2017 one but I forgot.

trivia: |-
  - Name is derived from [<i>Sarracenia flava</i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarracenia_flava)\* and a loose association with Fleischer Studios (see song above); "flava" = fl + ava.
     - \*If she has a plant association, it's a dandelion, not a pitcher plant.
