## stats
- age 15 (2012), 20 (if alive in 2017)
- 4\'06\"/XXXcm (2012), X\'XX\"/XXXcm (2017)

## summary
Random little girl in a creepy-ass mansion in the middle of the woods, what could possibly go wrong? Story status uncertain, but could be a ghost in 2017.

## info
- Tends to come off as a charming little girl scout with a knife behind her back, impression she exploits for fun—minus knife, although she *does* love taxidermy and is happy to elaborate. Big motormouth tendencies.
- One grandfather taught her how to skin a squirrel and the other read classic novels as bedtime stories. They made some *mistakes* with their youngest son, but far as Ava's concerned, they get an A+ in parenting this round.
- Probably died in 2012—although there are other versions of the story where she's still around 5 years later. In this case she's made a little name for herself in the local gay bar, in which she drinks absolutely nothing, listens to almost anyone for however long they talk, and advises people on becoming their best selves. Adult!Ava is also possibly friends with [Flynn] and later [Nico]({%include url.html%}/disaster-crew/nico).
- Has no WiFi at home and acts technologically illiterate when convenient. Plays a mean, vulgar game of Cards Against Humanity, and can do it with a straight face if she wants to.

## design notes
- <b>main shape</b>: Rounded hourglass, with occasional sharp corners.
- <b>color association(s)</b>: Yellow, overall. An older design has her in a green default outfit, but brown works too.
- Extremely unlikely to dress in modern/trendy clothes, no matter what year.
- Has a prosthetic right (viewer's left) foot, which may look jarringly mechanical in her usual environments; this dissonance is intentional.

## songs
- ["Swing You Sinners" – Fleischer Studios]
- ["Pavlov's Daughter" – Regina Spektor]

	- \*If she has a plant association, it's a dandelion, not a pitcher plant.
