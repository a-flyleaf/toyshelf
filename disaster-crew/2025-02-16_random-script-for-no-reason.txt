random script for no reason!!


[Ava at the bar/cafe/wherever. She laughs, waving off the waitress/whoever.
[Ivy sits down across from her.]

A: [":D???"] Yes...?
I: Nico's been talking to you.

[Beat. POV shot of Ava staring at her.]

A: Oh, don't worry. I know *exactly* [still in her POV, she holds up a hand; highlights the thumb ring! also puts her thumb under Ivy's chin lol] what you two have.

[Ivy eyes the ring. Sneers a little, with a huff.]


aaaand that's all I got! have half a mind to draw it out just to practice comicking.

cont'd...
> [There's a silence (zoom out, side view?); Ivy's turn to speak. She doesn't.]
> [Ava lowers her hand. Takes a sip, maybe.]
> A: In other words, I'm not interested in stealing your man. [read: oh, she didn't get the gay signal]
> I: You're that girl from the woods. [read: I'm not an idiot, this isn't about that (or like, maybe it lowkey is, but that's not her *intention*)]
> [Ava sputters for a second. Glances up, puts the cup down.
> [Leans in slightly.] A: Why don't we have this conversation somewhere else? [or: "There are better places to talk than this"? idk this is turning into a dialogue exercise]
> I [sitting up straighter]: *I* have nothing to hide.
> A: Oh, oh, neither do I! [Lying, ofc.] It's just, considering what happened to our friend--
> [Ivy's turn to ??slam the table, or smthn else abrupt if not so dramatic. Abruptly pissed, though, hissing] I: Tara was *not* your friend.
> A [wry, dead smile]: I don't think that's your call to make.
hm. you could cut this tension with a fork.

+alternative to the "somewhere else": "They'll be putting on a concert here soon--" "I don't plan on staying." same idea, more subtext-y?
