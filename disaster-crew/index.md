## Who are these people?
**2012.** I don't have human characters, largely because I don't like drawing human beings. But I like the <i>Pokémon</i> franchise, and I admire the heck out of people who take the blank slate player characters and make something all their own.

In April, [the player characters of the <i>Black&nbsp;2 & White&nbsp;2</i> games leak](https://bulbanews.bulbagarden.net/wiki/May_issue_of_CoroCoro_magazine_leaked), and I immediately start going ham on "headcanons." Thus spawn the earliest iterations of Nico and Ivy (the first two shown above). When I actually played through the game, I messed with the plot based on the characters I'd come up with, and later even had some some vague ideas for where the duo would end up as adults---

And then I got sucked into <i>XY</i> headcanon hell and that took over my writing for a while. (It eventually turned into [<i>The Firebird Effect</i>](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/projects/tfe/). Needless to say, I learned how to draw humans.)

**2017--18.** My interest in <i>TFE</i> is waning, and something that I keep seeing (in my own and others' work) is that trying to align one's story with the original game's plot can be a hindrance. Returning to the "disaster duo," I divorced their story from Pokémon entirely---which warranted some character replacements (Tara, Vexus, and kinda Ava) and, by extension, new people (Levi and Dodder). But despite development tying most of them together in some way, I didn't stick with any particular "main story" idea long enough for anything to coalesce an Established Project Canon.

So here we are, in **2022(--3)**, and the crew kinda just Exists (as they have for years) and I'm not doing anything else with them. While I've intermittently revisited certain concepts in other projects since, I don't have a specific uniting plot for *this* group (and if I ever *do* commit to one, there could be significant changes), so I figured they'd be good candidates for this little website-experiment-thing.

### side note on years
The character timelines have two distinct phases, 5 years apart: 2012 and 2017. It's based more on the dates I was developing things <abbr title="in real life">IRL</abbr> than any in-story reason---but characterizations very much reflect the times, and would be different if shifted to a modern era.

Which, yes, increasingly makes the whole thing a time capsule. I don't know how to feel about that.

Anyway, all instances of years in profiles are 100% **in-universe** unless otherwise noted.
