## Who are these people?
It started in 2012 with Nico and Ivy, who were originally my "headcanon" versions of <i>Pokémon Black 2 & White 2</i> protagonists Nate and Rosa. I screwed around with the game's plot and ended up with a vague idea of where they'd end up as adults, and then I got sucked into <i>XY</i> headcanon hell and that took over my writing instead. (It eventually turned into [<i>The Firebird Effect</i>](https://a-flyleaf.github.io/projects/tfe/).)

Fast-forward to 2017--18. With my interest in <i>TFE</i> waning, my creative focus wandered back to the "disaster duo." Just for the heck of it I divorced their story from Pokémon entirely, which warranted some character replacements and also new people. Despite development tying most people together in some way, I didn't stick with any particular idea long enough for it to coalesce as an Established Project Canon.

So here we are, in 2022, and they kinda just Exist (as they have for years) and I'm not doing anything else with them. While I've intermittently revisited certain concepts in other projects since, I don't plan on turning any of this into A Project (and if I *did* there would probably be significant changes), so I figured they'd be good candidates for this little website-experiment-thing.

### side note on years
The "story" timeline has two distinct phases, 5 years apart: 2012 and 2017. It's based more on the dates I was developing things <abbr title="in real life">IRL</abbr> than any in-story reason; as time marches on, this renders the story something of a historical fiction, and I don't know how to feel about that.

Anyway, all instances of years in profiles are 100% **in-universe** unless otherwise noted.
