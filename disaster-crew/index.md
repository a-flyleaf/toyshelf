## Who are these people?
It started in 2012 with Nico and Ivy, originally my "headcanon" versions of *Pokémon Black 2 & White 2* protagonists Nate and Rosa. I screwed around with the plot and ended up with a vague idea of where they'd end up as adults, and then I got sucked into *XY* headcanon hell (which eventually turned into [<i>The Firebird Effect</i>].

Fast-forward to 2017--18. With my interest in <i>TFE</i> waning, my creative focus wandered back to the "disaster duo." Just for the heck of it I divorced their story from Pokémon entirely, which warranted some character replacements and also new people. Although I (re)developed backstories and tied most of them together in some way, I didn't stick with any of it long enough for it to coalesce as an Established Project Canon.

So here we are, in 2022, and they kinda just Exist (as they have for years) and I'm not doing anything else with them. While I've intermittently revisited certain concepts since, I don't plan on turning any of this into A Project (and if I *did* there would probably be significant changes), so I figured they'd be good candidates for this little website-experiment-thing.

### side note on years
The "story" timeline has two distinct phases, 5 years apart: 2012 and 2017. Yes, this is based on IRL dates. The main thing this affects is like, background technology usage (i.e., Nico used Vine as a kid).

Besides this page, all instances of years are 100% in-universe unless otherwise noted. <!--fonts would be a good way to distinguish this better!!-->
