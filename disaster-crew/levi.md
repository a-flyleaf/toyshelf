summary: |-
  [Vexus](vexus)' bestest best buddy pal bestie in the whole wide world, which makes Vexus a very lucky guy.
  
  (Side note: Uses both he/him and she/her pronouns. It alternates in the notes below.)

info: |-
  - Horrifically underappreciated, in her own opinion; doesn't bother with most people. Often mistaken for a shy, quiet nerd; the masses misunderstand her motive.
  - His kid-baby siblings drive him up a wall but he patiently takes care of them anyway, like a good obedient child who doesn't deserve to be yelled at. *Hates* sucking up to adults like this, but desperate times...
  - May already know Vexus when "the story" starts, or their meeting is some type of catalyst. After Vexus played hooky, Levi, assuming this proved Vexus' rebel credentials, introduced herself. Alas, some first impressions were not meant to be.
  - Wants to be a dentist when he grows up, because the damn dummies who worked on *his* teeth didn't do it right and now he's gotta show them how it's done. Med school sounds like a pain in the ass, though; he just wants to skip to scum-scraping.

design: |-
  - <b>main shape</b>: None in particular, kind of a mishmash.
  - <b>color association(s)</b>: Saturated purple.
  - A Nerd™; glasses and braces are key, everything else not so much.
  - Tends to go for tighter clothing.
  - Would follow the trends if she had the budget but all she's got are these shitty hand-me-down sneakers, so actually, fuck the mainstream and their overpriced fabrics.
