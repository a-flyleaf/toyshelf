summary: >-
  [Nico](nico)'s best friend, "autism sister" to the kid later known as [Vexus](vexus), and general chill teen trying not to freak out about college or life or her friends' crises or whatever.

info: |-
  - Towers over most people, which is awkward, but tries to play nice with everyone. Evidently had some issues that weren't being addressed.
  - Always let her sibling win at video games; against Nico, actually tried to win, but rarely succeeded. Often heard in the background of Nico's vines saying some variation of "dude, don't do it" (while filming and laughing).
  - Voted MVP of the local robotics club, subsequently dubbed by Nico "the nerdiest nerd of all the nerds" (playfully derogatory).
  - Met [Ava](ava) in 2012.
  - Went missing the same year; eventually presumed dead by suicide.

  - The side-shave haircut was getting a "test run" in 2012.
  - Probably could've kept growing.
