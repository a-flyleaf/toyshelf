summary: >-
  [Nico](nico)'s best friend, "autism sister" to the kid later known as [Vexus](vexus), and general chill teen trying not to freak out about college or life or her friends' crises or whatever.

info: |-
  - Towers over most people, which is awkward, but tries to play nice with everyone. Evidently had some issues that weren't being addressed.
  - Always let her sibling win at video games; meanwhile, actually tried to beat Nico sometimes, but rarely succeeded. Often heard in the background of Nico's vines saying some variation of "dude, don't do it" (while filming and laughing).
  - Voted MVP of the local robotics club, subsequently dubbed by Nico "the nerdiest nerd of all the nerds" (playfully derogatory).
  - Met [Ava](ava) in 2012. Went missing the same year; eventually presumed dead by suicide.

design: |-
  - <b>main shape</b>: Vaguely crescent; generally *super* lanky.
  - <b>color association(s)</b>: Neon yellow-green.
  - The side-shave haircut was getting a "test run" in 2012.
  - Probably could've kept growing.
  - Wore an hourglass necklace. <!--this isn't necessary if it's in the art-->

  [Linda Cardellini as Wendy Corduroy (<i>Gravity Falls</i>)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOQdzPLS4og) (don't read into the video choice, it just had better audio than other compilations)

trivia: |-
  - Name is derived from [<i>Taraxacum officinale</i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taraxacum_officinale) and an anagram of "-cenia" (from [<i>Sarracenia flava</i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarracenia_flava)).
    - \*If she has a plant association, it's a pitcher plant, not a dandelion.
