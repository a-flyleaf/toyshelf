## summary
[Nico]({%include url.html%}/disaster-crew/nico)'s best friend, "autism sister" to the kid later known as [Vexus]({%include url.html%}/disaster-crew/vexus), and general chill teen trying not to freak out about college or life or her friends' crises or whatever.

## info
- Towers over most people, which is awkward, but tries to play nice with everyone. Evidently had some issues that weren't being addressed.
- Always let her sibling win at video games; against Nico, actually tried to win, but rarely succeeded. Often heard in the background of Nico's vines saying some variation of "dude, don't do it" (while filming and laughing).
- Voted MVP of the local robotics club, subsequently dubbed by Nico "the nerdiest nerd of all the nerds" (playfully derogatory).
- Met [Ava]({%include url.html%}/disaster-crew/ava) before she (Tara) went missing in 2012; eventually presumed dead by suicide.

## design notes
- <b>main shape</b>: Vaguely crescent; genearlly *super* lanky.
- <b>color association(s)</b>: Neon yellow-green.
- The side-shave haircut was getting a "test run" in 2012.
- Probably could've kept growing.
- Wore an hourglass necklace. <!--this isn't necessary if it's in the art-->
