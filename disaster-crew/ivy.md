# "Ivy" Espinosa-Rodriguez

## stats

- X\'XX\"/XXXcm (2012), 5\'07\"/XXXcm (2017)

## summary
Half of the "disaster duo." Begrudging waitress by day, more enthusiastic music-mixer by night, and responsible 24/7 for [Nico]({%include url.html%}/disaster-crew/nico)'s will to live.

## info
- 2012: withdrawn, albeit not entirely by choice; never seen without trusted dog Buddy.<br/>2017: has taught herself how to be a functional human being, and really really *really* wants Nico to do the same. (He doesn't appreciate it much.)
- Could go the rest of her life without seeing another lonely man's grimy apartmnet. Has always followed a social script and does not like deviation.
- Legal first name is *Ana* but privately went by "Ivy" as a kid. Nico still uses it and she thinks that's sweet.
- Met [Tara]({%include url.html%}/disaster-crew/tara) as a kid over unpopular opinions about anime, most of which Ivy still remembers (despite herself). Listens to murder mysteries in the car, all of which are blissfully easier to solve than Nico's neverending mental health crises.

## design notes
- <b>main shape</b>: Oval; no right angles.
- <b>color association(s)</b>: Cyan, which was faded as a kid.
- In 2017, has a (small, often heavily-covered) scar down her lower lip, and (less-covered, outside work) tattoos around her wrists and at the clavicle.

## songs
- 2012: ["Sleepsong" – Bastille]
- 2014–5: ["Desperado" – Rihanna]
- general: ["Pin" – Grimes (cover)]

## voiceclaim
- 2012: Naomi McDonald as Claire Cooper (<i>The Amazing World of Gumball</i>)
- 2017: \[N/A]

## trivia
- Surname and legal name have changed over the (irl) years; "Ivy" has not, and is based on the [fan nickname "Ivory"]. It's *way* too fitting to change.
