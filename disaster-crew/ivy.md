summary: >-
  Half of the "disaster duo." Begrudging waitress by day, more enthusiastic music-mixer by night, and responsible 24/7 for [Nico](nico)'s will to live.

info: |-
  - 2012: withdrawn, albeit not entirely by choice; never seen without trusted dog Buddy.<br/>2017: has taught herself how to be a functional human being, and really really *really* wants Nico to do the same. (He doesn't appreciate it much.)
  - Could go the rest of her life without seeing another lonely man's grimy apartment. Has always followed a social script and does not like deviation.
  - Legal first name is *Ana* but privately went by "Ivy" as a kid. Nico still uses the moniker and she thinks that's sweet.
  - Met [Tara](tara) as a kid over unpopular opinions about anime, most of which Ivy still remembers (despite herself).
  - Listens to murder mysteries in the car, all of which are blissfully easier to solve than Nico's neverending mental health crises.

design: |-
  - <b>main shape</b>: Oval; no right angles.
  - <b>color association(s)</b>: Cyan, which was faded as a kid.
  - Until 2012 (and a bit into the next year), had to wear a purity ring.
  - In 2017, has a (small, often heavily-covered) scar down her lower lip, and (less-covered, outside work) tattoos around her wrists and at the clavicle.

songs: |-
  - ["Sleepsong" – Bastille](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cuR_Vi6vas) (2012)
  - ["Pin" – Grimes (cover)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqTpu6PB_Fg)
  - ["Desperado" – Rihanna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSup7sP2IwQ) (2014–5)

voice: |-
  - 2012: Naomi McDonald as Claire Cooper (<i>The Amazing World of Gumball</i>)

trivia: |-
  - "Ivy" is based on "Ivory," one of the pre-English-release names people gave the <i>Pokémon Black2/White2</i> [girl protag](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Rosa). The original plant correlation ended up, ahem, *clinging*.
