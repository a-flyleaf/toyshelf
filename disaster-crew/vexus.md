summary: <abbr title="sad-mad">Smad</abbr> little dude. [Tara](tara)'s sibling, best friend of [Levi](levi)'s.

info: |-
  - Selectively mute (*not* deaf), which applies 99%\* of the time; to avoid people making a fuss over it, avoids everyone whenever possible. (\*The 1% used to be reserved for family. It's nearly 0% nowadays.) Doesn't go out of his way to be a jerk, usually.
  - Sister's dead, shit sucks, moved house, outta luck; now what? Storyline somewhat uncertain, but probably involves revisiting Tara's old friends ([Nico](nico) & [Ivy](ivy)), dealing with his *new* friend Levi, and meeting some version of [Ava](ava).
  - Possibly vaguely aware of [Dodder](dodder), if the latter is story-relevant, in a "stop using my dead sister for your stupid culty self-help bullshit" way.
  - Finally got a kitten after years of wanting in early 2012. Then let her out by accident and never saw her alive again.
  - Keeps a venus flytrap in his post-move bedroom, as well as photos and mementos of Tara---the only traces of her existence on display in the whole house.

design: |-
  - <b>main shape</b>: Rounded octagon.
  - <b>color association(s)</b>: Dull yellow-green.
  - Outfits usually involve big sweaters and heavy boots; shielded, even in summer.
  - Wears Tara's hourglass necklace (which is now cracked), usually tucked safely under his sweatshirt.

songs: |-
  - ["Good Grief" – Bastille](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDY4Bf8Zwn8)

voice: |-
  - Cavetown, specifically in this one song that I don't remember. Don't thiiink it applied as much in general?
  - "Joshua Talbott" in [a fake commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHPOZJe0Inc) (<i>The Onion</i>)

trivia: |-
  - I have no idea where I got his moniker from. It... sounded cool...? Which is all the reasoning an edgy tween needs. Surname, meanwhile, is an anagram of "-cenia," from [<i>Sarracenia flava</i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarracenia_flava).
    - If he has a plant association, it's a venus flytrap, not a pitcher plant.
