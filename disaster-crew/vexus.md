summary: <abbr title="sad-mad">Smad</abbr> little dude. [Tara](tara)'s sibling, best friend of [Levi](levi)'s.

info: |-
  - Selectively mute (*not* deaf), which applies to 99%\* of situations; to avoid people making a fuss over it, avoids everyone wholesale. (\*The 1% used to be reserved for family. It's nearly 0% nowadays.) Doesn't go out of his way to be a jerk, usually.
  - Sister's dead, shit sucks, moved house, outta luck; now what? Story status somewhat uncertain, but probably involves revisiting Tara's old friends ([Nico](nico) & [Ivy](ivy)) and dealing with his *new* friend Levi.
  - Possibly vaguely aware of [Dodder](dodder), if the latter is story-relevant, in a "stop using my dead sister for your stupid culty self-help bullshit" way.
  - Used to have a long-wanted kitten, but let her out by accident and never saw her alive again. Keeps at least one venus flytrap in his room, along with the only displayed evidence of Tara's existence in the whole new house.

design: |-
  - <b>main shape</b>: Rounded octagon.
  - <b>color association(s)</b>: Dull yellow-green.

trivia: |-
