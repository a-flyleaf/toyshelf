## summary
<abbr title="sad-mad">Smad</abbr> little dude. [Tara]({%include url.html%}/disaster-crew/tara)'s sibling, best friend of [Levi]({%include url.html%}/disaster-crew/levi)'s.

## info
- Selectively mute (*not* deaf), which applies to 99%\* of situations; to avoid people making a fuss over it, avoids everyone wholesale. (\*The 1% used to be reserved for family. It's nearly 0% nowadays.) Doesn't go out of his way to be a jerk, usually.
- Sister's dead, shit sucks, moved house, outta luck; now what? Story status somewhat uncertain, but probably involves revisiting Tara's old friends ([Nico]({%include url.html%}/disaster-crew/nico) & [Ivy]({%include url.html%}/disaster-crew/ivy)) and dealing with his *new* friend Levi.
- Possibly vaguely aware of [Dodder]({%include url.html%}/disaster-crew/dodder), if the latter is story-relevant, in a "stop using my dead sister for your stupid culty self-help bullshit" way.
- Used to have a long-wanted kitten, but let her out by accident and never saw her alive again. Keeps at least one venus flytrap in his room, along with the only displayed evidence of Tara's existence in the whole new house.

## design notes
- <b>main shape</b>: Rounded octagon.
- <b>color association(s)</b>: Dull yellow-green.
- Outfits usually involve big sweaters and heavy boots; shielded, even in summer.
- Wears Tara's hourglass necklace (which is now cracked), usually tucked safely between his clothing layers.
